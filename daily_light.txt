   JANUARY 1 MORNING

   This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind,. . . I
   press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
   Christ Jesus.--PHI. 3:13,14.

   Father, I will that they . . . whom thou hast given me, be with me
   where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me.--I
   know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep
   that which I have committed unto him against that day.--He which hath
   begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.

   Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth
   the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for
   the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a
   corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.--Let us lay aside every
   weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with
   patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus.

   John 17:24. -II Tim. 1:12. -Phi. 1:6.I Cor. 9:24,25. -Heb. 12:1,2.

   JANUARY 1 EVENING

   The Lord, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he
   will not fail thee.--DEUT. 31:8.

   If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.--O Lord, I know
   that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to
   direct his steps.

   The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in
   his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the
   Lord upholdeth him with his hand.

   I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. Thou
   shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.--I
   am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
   principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
   height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
   from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

   Exo. 33:15. -Jer. 10:23.Psa. 37:23,24.Psa. 73:23,24. -Rom. 8:38,39.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 2 MORNING

   Sing unto the Lord a new song.--ISA. 42:10.

   Sing aloud unto God our strength; make a joyful noise unto the God of
   Jacob. Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp
   with the psaltery.--He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise
   unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.

   Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou
   dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou
   goest.--The joy of the Lord is your strength.--Paul . . . thanked God,
   and took courage.

   Knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for
   now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far
   spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of
   darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly,
   as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and
   wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus
   Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts
   thereof.

   Psa. 81:1,2. -Psa. 40:3.Josh. 1:9. -Neh. 8:10. -Acts 28:15.Rom. 13:11-14.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 2 EVENING

   Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up
   of my hands as the evening sacrifice.--PSA. 141:2.

   Thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: . . . and thou shalt put
   it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the
   mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. And
   Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: . . . and when
   Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a
   perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations.

   [Jesus] is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by
   him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.--The smoke of
   the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up
   before God out of the angel's hand. Ye also, as lively stones, are
   built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
   sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Pray without ceasing.

   Exo. 30:1,6-8.Heb. 7:25. -Rev. 8:4.I Pet. 2:5.I Thes. 5:17.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 3 MORNING

   He led them forth by the right way.--PSA. 107:7.

   He found [Jacob] in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness;
   he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his
   eye. As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
   spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so
   the Lord alone did lead him.--Even to your old age I am he; and even to
   hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will
   carry, and will deliver you.

   He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for
   his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
   death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff
   they comfort me.

   The Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought,
   and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and
   like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.--For this GOD is our GOD
   for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death. Who teacheth
   like him?

   Deut. 32:10-12. -Isa. 46:4.Psa. 23:3,4.Isa. 58:11. -Psa. 48:14.Job 36:22.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 3 EVENING

   What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee . . . Lord, that I may receive
   my sight.--LUKE 18:41.

   Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.

   Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the
   scriptures.--The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
   will send in my name, . . . shall teach you all things.--Every good
   gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the
   Father of lights.

   The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, . . . give unto
   you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: the
   eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is
   the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his
   inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his
   power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty
   power.

   Psa. 119:18.Luke 24:45. -John 14:26. -Jas. 1:17.Eph. 1:17-19.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 4 MORNING

   Ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the
   Lord your God giveth you.--DEUT. 12:9.

   This is not your rest.--There remaineth therefore a rest to the people
   of God.--Within the veil; whither the forerunner is for us entered,
   even Jesus.

   In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have
   told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a
   place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that
   where I am, there ye may be also.--With Christ; which is far better.

   God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no
   more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more
   pain; for the former things are passed away.--There the wicked cease
   from troubling: and there the weary be at rest.

   Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven. For where your treasure is,
   there will your heart be also.--Set your affection on things above, not
   on things on the earth.

   -Mic. 2:10. -Heb. 4:9. -Heb. 6:19,20.John 14:2,3. -Phi. 1:23.Rev. 21:4.
   -Job 3:17.Matt. 6:20,21. -Col. 3:2.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 4 EVENING

   O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?--I COR. 15:55.

   The sting of death is sin.--But now once in the end of the world hath
   he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And as it is
   appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: so Christ
   was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for
   him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.

   As the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself
   likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him
   that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who
   through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.

   I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
   I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the
   faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.

   I Cor. 15:56. -Heb. 9:26-28.Heb. 2:14,15.II Tim. 4:6-8.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 5 MORNING

   We which have believed do enter into rest.--HEB. 4:3.

   They weary themselves to commit iniquity.--I see another law in my
   members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into
   captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that
   I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

   Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
   you rest.--Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
   Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace
   wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

   He that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own
   works.--Not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but
   that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is
   of God by faith.--This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to
   rest; and this is the refreshing.

   Jer. 9:5. -Rom. 7:23,24.Matt. 11:28. -Rom. 5:1,2.Heb. 4:10. -Phi. 3:9.
   -Isa. 28:12.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 5 EVENING

   Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.--PSA. 141:3.

   If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
   stand?--They provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his
   lips.

   Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which
   cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

   A whisperer separateth chief friends.--There is that speaketh like the
   piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health. The lip of
   truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a
   moment.--The tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of
   deadly poison. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing.
   My brethren, these things ought not so to be.

   Put off . . . anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out
   of your mouth. Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the
   old man with his deeds.--This is the will of God, even your
   sanctification.--In their mouth was found no guile.

   Psa. 130:3. -Psa. 106:33.Matt. 15:11.Prov. 16:28. -Prov. 12:18,19.
   -Jas. 3:8,10.Col. 3:8,9. -I Thes. 4:3. -Rev. 14:5.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 6 MORNING

   Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us: and establish thou the
   work of our hands.--PSA. 90:17.

   Thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was
   perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the
   Lord GOD.--We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of
   the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as
   by the Spirit of the Lord.--The Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon
   us.

   Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord; that walketh in his ways.
   For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and
   it shall be well with thee.--Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy
   thoughts shall be established.

   Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God
   which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.--Our
   Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved
   us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through
   grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and
   work.

   Ezek. 16:14. -II Cor. 3:18. -I Pet. 4:14.Psa. 128:1,2. -Prov. 16:3.Phi. 2:12,13. -II Thes. 2:16,17.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 6 EVENING

   The apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all
   things they had done.--MARK 6:30.

   There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.--The Lord spake
   unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.--Ye are my
   friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I call you not
   servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have
   called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I
   have made known unto you.

   When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say,
   We are unprofitable servants.

   Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have
   received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

   In every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
   requests be made known unto God.--The prayer of the upright is his
   delight.

   Prov. 18:24. -Exo. 33:11. -John 15:14,15.Luke 17:10.Rom. 8:15.Phi. 4:6.
   -Prov. 15:8.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 7 MORNING

   Think upon me, my God, for good.--NEH. 5:19.

   Thus saith the Lord; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the
   love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the
   wilderness.--I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy
   youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.--I will
   visit you, and perform my good word toward you.--For I know the
   thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace,
   and not of evil, to give you an expected end.

   As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than
   your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.--I would seek unto God,
   and unto God would I commit my cause: which doeth great things and
   unsearchable; marvelous things without number.--Many, O Lord my God,
   are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which
   are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I
   would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered.

   Jer. 2:2. -Ezek. 16:60. -Jer. 29:10. -Jer. 29:11.Isa. 55:9. -Job. 5:8,9. -Psa. 40:5.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 7 EVENING

   I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.--JOSH. 1:5.

   There failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto
   the house of Israel; all came to pass.--God is not a man, that he
   should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he
   said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make
   it good?

   The Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant
   and mercy with them that love him.--He will ever be mindful of his
   covenant.

   Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
   compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not
   forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.

   The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will
   rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over
   thee with singing.

   Josh. 21:45. -Num. 23:19.Deut. 7:9. -Psa. 111:5.Isa. 49:15,16.Zeph. 3:17.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 8 MORNING

   They that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord,
   hast not forsaken them that seek thee.--PSA. 9:10.

   The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it,
   and is safe.--I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is
   my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.

   I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous
   forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.--For the Lord loveth judgment,
   and forsaketh not his saints, they are preserved for ever: but the seed
   of the wicked shall be cut off.--The Lord will not forsake his people
   for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the Lord to make you
   his people.--Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver:
   in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us.

   Be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never
   leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my
   helper, I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

   Prov. 18:10. -Isa. 12:2.Psa. 37:25. -Psa. 37:28. -I Sam. 12:22. -II
   Cor. 1:10.Heb. 13:5,6.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 8 EVENING

   They are without fault before the throne of God.--REV. 14:5.

   The iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none;
   and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon
   them whom I reserve.--Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth
   iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his
   heritage? he retaineth not his anger forever, because he delighteth in
   mercy. He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will
   subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the
   depths of the sea.

   He hath made us accepted in the beloved.--To present you holy and
   unblameable and unreproveable in his sight.

   Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you
   faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the
   only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power,
   both now and ever. Amen.

   Jer. 50:20. -Mic. 7:18,19.Eph. 1:6. -Col. 1:22.Jude 24,25.

   JANUARY 9 MORNING

   Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be
   displayed because of the truth.--PSA. 60:4.

   Jehovah Nissi (The Lord my banner).--When the enemy shall come in like
   a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.

   We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will
   set up our banners.--The Lord hath brought forth our righteousness:
   come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the Lord our God.--We are
   more than conquerors through him that loved us.--Thanks be to God,
   which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.--The captain
   of our salvation.

   My brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
   might.--Valiant for the truth.--Fight the Lord's battles.--Be strong,
   all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: fear ye not.--Lift
   up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to
   harvest.--Yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and
   will not tarry.

   Exo. 17:15. -Isa. 59:19.Psa. 20:5. -Jer. 51:10. -Rom. 8:37. -I Cor. 15:57. -Heb. 2:10.Eph. 6:10. -Jer. 9:3. -I Sam. 18:17. -Hag. 2:4,5.

   JANUARY 9 EVENING

   One thing is needful.--LUKE 10:42.

   There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up
   the light of thy countenance upon us. Thou hast put gladness in my
   heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.

   As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after
   thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God.--O God,
   thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my
   flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is.

   I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he
   that believeth on me shall never thirst. Lord, evermore give us this
   bread.--Mary . . . sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.--One thing
   have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in
   the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of
   the Lord, and to enquire in his temple.

   Psa. 4:6,7.Psa. 42:1,2. -Psa. 63:1.John 6:35,34,Luke 10:39. -Psa. 27:4.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 10 MORNING

   I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless
   unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.--I THES. 5:23.

   Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might present
   it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any
   such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.--Whom we
   preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that
   we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

   The peace of God . . . passeth all understanding.--Let the peace of God
   rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body.

   Our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God, even our Father, which hath
   loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope
   through grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word
   and work.--Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be
   blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   JANUARY 10 EVENING

   Will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth?--II CHR. 6:18.

   Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.--I will meet
   with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by
   my glory. And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be
   their God.

   Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast
   received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord God
   might dwell among them.

   Ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in
   them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my
   people.--Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you.--Ye
   . . . are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.

   The heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when my
   sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.

   JANUARY 11 MORNING

   Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion.--PSA. 65:1.

   To us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we
   in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by
   him.--All men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He
   that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent
   him.--By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
   continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
   name.--Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth
   his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.

   I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all
   nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, stood before the
   throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in
   their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God
   which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. Amen: Blessing, and
   glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might,
   be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.

     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 11 EVENING

   Who redeemeth thy life from destruction.--PSA. 103:4.

   Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name.--I will ransom
   them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O
   death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction.

   As the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself
   likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him
   that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who
   through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.

   He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that
   believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth
   on him.

   Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who

   glory.--When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be
   admired in all them that believe.

   JANUARY 12 MORNING

   The only wise God our Saviour--JUDE 25:1.

   Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
   sanctification, and redemption.--Canst thou by searching find out God?
   canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is as high as
   heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?

   We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which
   God ordained before the world unto our glory.--The mystery, which from
   the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things
   by Jesus Christ: to the intent that now unto the principalities and
   powers in heavenly places might be known, by the church, the manifold
   wisdom of God.

   If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
   liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.--The wisdom
   that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to
   be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and
   without hypocrisy.

   I Cor. 1:30. -Job 11:7,8.I Cor. 2:7. -Eph. 3:9,10.Jas. 1:5. -Jas. 3:17.

   JANUARY 12 EVENING

   When shall I arise, and the night be gone?--JOB 7:4.

   Watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh.

   Yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not
   tarry.--He shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,
   even a morning without clouds.

   I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for
   you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am,
   there ye may be also. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be
   afraid. Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again
   unto you.

   Let all thine enemies perish, O Lord; but let them that love him be as
   the sun when he goeth forth in his might.--Ye are all the children of
   light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of
   darkness.

   There shall be no night there.

   JANUARY 13 MORNING

   Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
   thee.--ISA. 26:3.

   Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee; he shall
   never suffer the righteous to be moved.--I will trust, and not be
   afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is
   become my salvation.

   Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?--Be careful for nothing; but
   in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
   requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth
   all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ
   Jesus.--In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.

   The effect of righteousness [shall be] quietness and assurance for
   ever.--Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the
   world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither
   let it be afraid.--Peace, from him which is, and which was, and which
   is to come.

   JANUARY 13 EVENING

   Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.--EPH. 4:26.

   If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault
   between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy
   brother . . . Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I
   forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto
   thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.--When ye stand
   praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also
   which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.

   Put on, therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
   mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
   forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a
   quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.--Be ye
   kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God
   for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

   The apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.

   Matt. 18:15,21,22. -Mark 11:25.Col. 3:12,13. -Eph. 4:32.Luke 17:5.

   JANUARY 14 MORNING

   My Father is greater than I.--JOHN 14:28.

   When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven.--My Father, and your
   Father; . . . my God and your God. As the Father gave me commandment,
   even so I do.--The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself:
   but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.

   The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his
   hand.--Thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give
   eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.

   Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him,
   Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me,
   Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou
   then, Shew us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father,
   and the Father in me?--I and my Father are one.--As the Father hath
   loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. If ye keep my
   commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my
   Father's commandments, and abide in his love.

   Luke 11:2. -John 20:17.John 14:31. -John 14:10.John 3:35. -John 17:2.John 14:8-10. -John 10:30. -John 15:9,10

   JANUARY 14 EVENING

   [The woman's seed] shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
   heel.--GEN. 3:15.

   His visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the
   sons of men.--He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for
   our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with
   his stripes we are healed.

   This is your hour, and the power of darkness.--Thou couldest have no
   power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.

   The Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the
   devil.--He cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak,
   because they knew him.

   All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.--In my name shall
   they cast out devils.

   The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.

   Isa. 52:14. -Isa. 53:5.Luke 22:53. -John 19:11.I John 3:8. -Mark 1:34.Matt. 28:18. -Mark 16:17.Rom. 16:20.

   JANUARY 15 MORNING

   My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy
   word.--PSA. 119:25.

   If ye . . . be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,
   where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on
   things above, not on things on the earth. For your life is hid with
   Christ in God.--Our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look
   for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body,
   that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the
   working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.

   The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh;
   and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the
   things that ye would.--Brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to
   live after the flesh. For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but
   if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
   live.--Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain
   from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.

   Col. 3:1-3. -Phi. 3:20,21.Gal. 5:17. -Rom. 8:12.13. -I Pet. 2:11.

   JANUARY 15 EVENING

   The measure of faith.--ROM. 12:3.

   Him that is weak in the faith.--Strong in faith, giving glory to God.

   O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?--Great is thy
   faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.

   Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord . .
   . According to your faith be it unto you.

   Lord, increase our faith.--Building up yourselves on your most holy
   faith.--Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith.--He
   which stablisheth us with you in Christ, . . . is God.--The God of all
   grace . . . after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect,
   stablish, strengthen, settle you.

   We . . . that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and
   not to please ourselves.--Let us not . . . judge one another . . . but
   judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to
   fall in his brother's way.

   Rom. 14:1. -Rom. 4:20.Matt. 14:31. -Matt. 15:28.Matt. 9:28,29.Luke 17:5. -Jude 20. -Col. 2:7. -II Cor. 1:21. -I Pet. 5:10.Rom. 15:1. -Rom. 14:13.

   JANUARY 16 MORNING

   It pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell.--COL. 1:19.

   The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his
   hand.--God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above
   every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things
   in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that
   every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of
   God the Father.--Far above all principality, and power, and might, and
   dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but
   also in that which is to come.--By him were all things created, that
   are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether
   they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things
   were created by him, and for him.

   Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of
   the dead and living.--And ye are complete in him, which is the head of
   all principality and power.--Of his fulness have all we received.

   Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and
   the things which shall be hereafter.--REV. 1:19.

   Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.--That which
   we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have
   fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and
   with his Son Jesus Christ.

   Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see;
   for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. And when he
   had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.--He that saw it
   bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true,
   that ye might believe.

   We have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto
   you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were
   eyewitnesses of his majesty.--That your faith should not stand in the
   wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

   JANUARY 17 MORNING

   Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of
   corruption.--ISA. 38:17.

   God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live
   through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved
   us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

   Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by
   the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his
   anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. He will turn again, he
   will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou
   wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.--O Lord my God, I
   cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me. O Lord, thou hast brought up
   my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go
   down to the pit.--When my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord:
   and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.--I waited
   patiently for the Lord. He brought me up . . . out of an horrible pit,
   out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock.

   The things which are.--REV. 1:19.

   Now we see through a glass, darkly.--Now we see not yet all things put
   under him.

   We have . . . a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that
   ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the
   day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.--Thy word is a lamp
   unto my feet, and a light unto my path.

   Beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles
   of our Lord Jesus Christ; how that they told you there should be
   mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly
   lusts.--The Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some
   shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and
   doctrines of devils.

   Little children, it is the last time.--The night is far spent, the day
   is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us
   put on the armour of light.

   I Cor. 13:12. -Heb. 2:8.II Pet. 1:19. -Psa. 119:105.Jude 17,18. -I Tim. 4:1.I John 2:18. -Rom. 13:12.

   JANUARY 18 MORNING

   Him that was to come.--ROM. 5:14.

   Jesus . . . made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of
   death, . . . that he by the grace of God should taste death for every
   man.--One died for all.--As by one man's disobedience many were made
   sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.

   The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a
   quickening spirit.--That was not first which is spiritual, but that
   which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.--God said, Let
   us make man in our image, after our likeness. So God created man in his
   own image, in the image of God created he him.--God . . . hath in these
   last days spoken unto us by his Son, the brightness of his glory, and
   the express image of his person.--Thou hast given him power over all
   flesh.

   The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from
   heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is
   the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.

   Things which shall be hereafter.--REV. 1:19.

   As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
   entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for
   them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his
   Spirit.--The Spirit of truth . . . will shew you things to come.

   Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they
   also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail
   because of him. Even so, Amen.

   I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which
   are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For
   if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which
   sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For the Lord himself shall
   descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and
   with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we
   which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the
   clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the
   Lord.

   I Cor. 2:9,10. -John 16:13.Rev. 1:7.I Thes. 4:13,14,16,17.

   JANUARY 19 MORNING

   Serving the Lord with all humility of mind.--ACTS 20:19.

   Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and
   whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: even as the
   Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give
   his life a ransom for many.

   If a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he
   deceiveth himself.--I say, through the grace given unto me, to every
   man, . . . not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think;
   but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the
   measure of faith.--When ye shall have done all those things which are
   commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that
   which was our duty to do.

   Our rejoicing is this, . . . that in simplicity and godly sincerity,
   not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our
   conversation in the world.--We have this treasure in earthen vessels,
   that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.

   JANUARY 19 EVENING

   We have turned every one to his own way.--ISA. 53:6.

   Noah . . . planted a vineyard: and he drank of the wine, and was
   drunken.--Abram . . . said unto Sara his wife, . . . Say, I pray thee,
   thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake.--Isaac
   said unto Jacob, . . . Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I
   am.--Moses . . . spake unadvisedly with his lips.--The men took of
   their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord. And
   Joshua made peace with them.--David did that which was right in the
   eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded
   him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the
   Hittite.

   These all . . . obtained a good report through faith.--Being justified
   freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ
   Jesus.--The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.

   Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you:
   be ashamed and confounded for your own ways.

   His name shall be called Wonderful.--ISA. 9:6.

   The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory,
   the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and
   truth.--Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.

   They shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with
   us.--JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

   All men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.--God . .
   . hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every
   name.--Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion,
   and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that
   which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet.--He had a
   name written, that no man knew, but he himself . . . KING OF KINGS, AND
   LORD OF LORDS.

   Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out.--What is his name, and
   what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?

   Ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.--I am my beloved's, and his
   desire is toward me.--I am his.--The Son of God . . . loved me, and
   gave himself for me.

   Ye are not your own, ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God
   in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.--The Lord hath taken
   you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt,
   to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.

   Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.--Christ as a son over
   his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and
   the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.--A spiritual house, an
   holy priesthood.

   They shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up
   my jewels.--All mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified
   in them.--The glory of his inheritance in the saints.

   Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it.--JOHN 15:2.

   He is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: and he shall sit
   as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of
   Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the
   Lord an offering in righteousness.

   We glory in tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
   and patience, experience; and experience, hope: and hope maketh not
   ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
   Holy Ghost which is given unto us.--If ye endure chastening, God
   dealeth with you as with sons, for what son is he whom the Father
   chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are
   partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. Now no chastening for
   the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward
   it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are
   exercised thereby. Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the
   feeble knees.

   Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name
   is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him that is of a
   contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to
   revive the heart of the contrite ones.

   Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide
   the spoil with the proud.--Blessed are the poor in spirit for their's
   is the kingdom of heaven.

   These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto
   him: a proud look, . . . .--Every one that is proud of heart is an
   abomination to the Lord.

   Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and
   see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way
   everlasting.

   Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
   Christ. I thank my God upon every remembrance of you.--Blessed are the
   meek: for they shall inherit the earth.

   O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for
   thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness
   and truth.--The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup.

   He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness, for his name's sake. Yea,
   though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
   evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort
   me.--Thou hast holden me by my right hand. Thou shalt guide me with thy
   counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but
   thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. My flesh
   and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my
   portion for ever.--Our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have

   me: thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of
   thine own hands.

   In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my
   soul.--PSA. 94:19.

   When my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than
   I.

   O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me.--Cast thy burden upon the
   Lord, and he shall sustain thee.

   I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.--If any
   of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, . . . and it shall be given
   him.

   Who is sufficient for these things?--I know that in me (that is, in my
   flesh,) dwelleth no good thing.--My grace is sufficient for thee: for
   my strength is made perfect in weakness.

   Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee . . . Daughter, be of
   good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.

   My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; . . . when I
   remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.

   JANUARY 23 MORNING

   Hope maketh not ashamed.--ROM. 5:5.

   I am the Lord: . . . they shall not be ashamed that wait for
   me.--Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the
   Lord is.--Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
   thee: because he trusteth in thee. Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for
   in the Lord JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.--My soul, wait thou only
   upon God; for my expectation is from him. He only is my rock and my
   salvation: he is my defense; I shall not be moved.--I am not ashamed,
   for I know whom I have believed.

   God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the
   immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two
   immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might
   have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
   the hope set before us; which hope we have as an anchor of the soul,
   both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
   whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus.

   Isa. 49:23. -Jer. 17:7. -Isa. 26:3,4. -Psa. 62:5,6. -II Tim. 1:12.Heb. 6:17-20.

   JANUARY 23 EVENING

   The offence of the cross.--GAL. 5:11.

   If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
   cross, and follow me.

   Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?
   whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of
   God.--We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.
   Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.--Unto you therefore
   which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the
   stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the
   corner, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence.

   God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
   world.--I am crucified with Christ.--They that are Christ's have
   crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.

   If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also
   will deny us.

   The Lord is at hand.--PHI. 4:5.

   The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice
   of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ
   shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught
   up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and
   so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with
   these words.--He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come
   quickly; Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

   Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent
   that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and
   blameless.--Abstain from all appearance of evil. And the very God of
   peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul
   and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.

   Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts; for the coming of the Lord
   draweth nigh.

   The choice vine.--GEN. 49:11.

   My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: and he fenced
   it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the
   choicest vine, . . . and he looked that it should bring forth grapes,
   and it brought forth wild grapes.--Yet I had planted thee a noble vine,
   wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant
   of a strange vine unto me.

   The works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery,
   fornication, uncleanness, . . . envyings, murders, drunkenness,
   revellings, and such like: . . . but the fruit of the Spirit is love,
   joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
   temperance.

   I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me
   that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth
   fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Abide in me,
   and I in you . . . Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much
   fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.

   The righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and
   upon all them that believe.--ROM. 3:22.

   He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be
   made the righteousness of God in him.--Christ hath redeemed us from the
   curse of the law, being made a curse for us.--Who of God is made unto
   us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.--Not
   by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his
   mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the
   Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
   Saviour.

   I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of
   Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things,
   and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him,
   not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which
   is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by
   faith.

   The spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.--ROM. 8:15.

   Jesus . . . lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, . . . Holy
   Father, . . . O righteous Father.--He said, Abba, Father.--Because ye
   are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts,
   crying, Abba, Father.--For through him we both have access by one
   Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and
   foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of
   God.

   Doubtless thou art our father, . . . thou, O Lord, art our father, our
   redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.

   I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have
   sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be
   called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. And he arose, and
   came to his father.

   Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children.

   JANUARY 26 MORNING

   Let us go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. For
   here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.--HEB. 13:13,14.

   Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to
   try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice,
   inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his
   glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.--As ye
   are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the
   consolation.

   If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the
   Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil
   spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.

   They departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they
   were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.--Choosing rather to
   suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures
   of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches
   than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of
   the reward.

   I Pet. 4:12.13. -II Cor. 1:7.I Pet. 4:14.Acts 5:41. -Heb. 11:25,26.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 26 EVENING

   The Lord Jesus Christ . . . shall change our vile body, that it may be
   fashioned like unto his glorious body.--PHI. 3:20,21.

   Upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a
   man above upon it. And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance
   of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even
   upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it
   were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. This
   was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.

   We all, with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
   are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the
   Spirit of the Lord.--It doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we
   know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see
   him as he is.

   They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more.--They sing the song
   of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb.

   Ezek. 1:26-28.II Cor. 3:18. -I John 3:2.Rev. 7:16. -Rev. 15:3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 27 MORNING

   Ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins: and in him is no
   sin.--I JOHN 3:5.

   God, . . . hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, who being
   the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and
   upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself
   purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.--He
   hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made
   the righteousness of God in him.

   Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear: forasmuch as ye know
   that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold;
   . . . but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
   blemish and without spot: who verily was foreordained before the
   foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for
   you.--The love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that
   if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that
   they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto
   him which died for them, and rose again.

   Heb. 1:13. -II Cor. 5:21.I Pet. 1:17-20. -II Cor. 5:14,15.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JANUARY 27 EVENING

   I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore
   choose life.--DEUT. 30:19.

   For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord
   God: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.

   If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now
   they have no cloke for their sin.

   That servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself,
   neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.

   The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through
   Jesus Christ our Lord.--He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting
   life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the
   wrath of God abideth on him.--Know ye not, that to whom ye yield
   yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey;
   whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?

   If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall
   also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.

   Ezek. 18:32.John 15:22.Luke 12:47.Rom. 6:23. -John 3:36.Rom. 6:16.John 12:26.

   As thy days, so shall thy strength be.--DEUT. 33:25.

   When they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought
   beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but
   whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is
   not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.--Take no thought for the morrow:
   for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient
   unto the day is the evil thereof.

   The God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people.
   Blessed be God.--He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no
   might he increaseth strength.

   My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in
   weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities,
   that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in
   infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in
   distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.--I
   can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.--O my soul,
   thou hast trodden down strength.

   Awake, O north wind, and . . . blow upon my garden, that the the spices
   thereof may flow out.--SONG 4:16.

   No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous:
   nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness
   unto them which are exercised thereby.--The fruit of the Spirit.

   He stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.

   Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that
   fear him.

   Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by
   day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for
   us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not
   at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.

   Though [Jesus] were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which
   he suffered.--In all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.

   JANUARY 29 MORNING

   Thou God seest me.--GEN. 16:13.

   O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my
   downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
   Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all
   my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou
   knowest it altogether . . . Such knowledge is too wonderful for me: it
   is high, I cannot attain unto it.

   The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the
   good.--The ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he
   pondereth all his goings.--God knoweth your hearts: for that which is
   highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.--The eyes
   of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself
   strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.

   Jesus . . . knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of
   man; for he knew what was in man.--Lord, thou knowest all things; thou
   knowest that I love thee.

   JANUARY 29 EVENING

   I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will

   Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me.--It is a good thing to give thanks
   unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High: to shew
   forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every
   night.

   Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord.

   I beseech you, . . . brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present
   your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is
   your reasonable service.--Jesus . . . that he might sanctify the people
   with his own blood, suffered without the gate. By him therefore let us
   offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of
   our lips giving thanks to his name.--Giving thanks always for all
   things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and
   wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.

   JANUARY 30 MORNING

   Let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto
   Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.--HEB. 12:1,2.

   If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
   cross daily, and follow me.--Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not
   all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.--Let us therefore cast off
   the works of darkness.

   Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now
   they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I
   therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that
   beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into
   subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I
   myself should be a castaway.--Brethren, I count not myself to have
   apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are
   behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press
   toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ
   Jesus.--Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.

   JANUARY 30 EVENING

   It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.--LAM. 3:27.

   Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will
   not depart from it.

   We have had fathers of our flesh, which corrected us; and we gave them
   reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of
   spirits, and live? For they verily for a few days chastened us after
   their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers
   of his holiness.

   Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. It
   is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy
   statutes.

   I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts
   of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.--Humble
   yourselves, therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt
   you in due time.

   If ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; .
   . . those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and
   thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye
   dwell.--NUM. 33:55.

   Fight the good fight of faith.--The weapons of our warfare are not
   carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds;
   casting down imaginations, . . . and bringing into captivity every
   thought to the obedience of Christ.

   Brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
   For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the
   Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.

   The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh;
   and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the
   things that ye would.--I see another law in my members, warring against
   the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin
   which is in my members.--We are more than conquerors through him that
   loved us.

   JANUARY 31 EVENING

   If a man sin against the Lord, who shall intreat for him?--I SAM. 2:25.

   If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
   righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours
   only, but also for the sins of the whole world.--Whom God hath set
   forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his
   righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the
   forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness:
   that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in
   Jesus.

   He is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the
   pit: I have found a ransom.

   What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be
   against us? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is
   Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the
   right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.

   Whom having not seen, ye love.--I PET. 1:8.

   We walk by faith, not by sight.--We love him, because he first loved
   us.--And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God
   is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in
   him.--In whom ye trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the
   gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were
   sealed with that holy Spirit of promise.--God would make known what is
   the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is
   Christ in you, the hope of glory.

   If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he
   that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom
   he hath not seen?

   Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast
   believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
   believed.--Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.

   The Lord Our Righteousness.--JER. 23:6.

   We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as
   filthy rags.

   I will go in the strength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy
   righteousness, even of thine only.--I will greatly rejoice in the Lord,
   my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the
   garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of
   righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a
   bride adorneth herself with her jewels.

   Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him.--To her was granted that
   she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine
   linen is the righteousness of saints.

   I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of
   Christ Jesus my Lord ... that I may win Christ, and be found in him,
   not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which
   is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by
   faith.

   FEBRUARY 2 MORNING

   Oh that thou wouldest keep me from evil.--I CHR. 4:10.

   Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.--The spirit
   indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

   Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:
   remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches,
   feed me with food convenient for me: lest I be full and deny thee, and
   say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name
   of my God in vain.

   The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy
   soul.--I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will
   redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.--He that is begotten of
   God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.

   Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee
   from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to
   try them that dwell upon the earth.--The Lord knoweth how to deliver
   the godly out of temptations.

   One star differeth from another star in glory.--I COR. 15:41.

   By the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the
   greatest. And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them,
   If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all.--Be
   clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to
   the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God,
   that he may exalt you in due time.

   Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who made
   himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and
   was made in the likeness of men. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted
   him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name
   of Jesus every knee should bow.

   They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and
   they that turn many to righeousness as the stars for ever and ever.

   Mark 9:34,35. -I Pet. 5:5,6.Phi. 2:5-7,9,10.Dan. 12:3.

   FEBRUARY 3 MORNING

   Be strong, and work; for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts.--HAG. 2:4.

   I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in
   him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do
   nothing.--I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth
   me.--Strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.--The joy of the
   Lord is your strength.

   Thus said the Lord of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in
   these days these words by the mouth of the prophets.--Strengthen ye the
   weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a
   fearful heart, Be strong, fear not.--The Lord looked upon him, and
   said, Go in this thy might.

   If God be for us, who can be against us?--Therefore seeing we have this
   ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not.

   Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if
   we faint not.--Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through
   our Lord Jesus Christ.

   FEBRUARY 3 EVENING

   The darkness hideth not from thee.--PSA. 139:12.

   His eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. There
   is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may
   hide themselves.--Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall
   not see him? . . . Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord.

   Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; . . . nor for the
   pestilence that walketh in darkness . . . Because thou hast made the
   Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation; there
   shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy
   dwelling.--He that keepeth thee will not slumber. The Lord is thy
   keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not
   smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee
   from all evil.

   Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
   fear no evil, for thou art with me.

   Job 34:21,22. -Jer. 23:24.Psa 91:5,6,9,10. -Psa. 121:3,5-7.Psa. 23:4.

   FEBRUARY 4 MORNING

   The Lord hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that
   way.--DEUT. 17:16.

   Truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came
   out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they
   desire a better country, that is a heavenly. Choosing rather to suffer
   affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
   for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
   treasures in Egypt.--The just shall live by faith: but if any man draw
   back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who
   draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the
   soul.--No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is
   fit for the kingdom of God.

   God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
   world.--Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord,
   and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.

   He which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day
   of Jesus Christ.

   Heb. 11:15,16,25,26. -Heb. 10:38,39. -Luke 9:62.Gal. 6:14. -II Cor. 6:17.Phi. 1:6.

   FEBRUARY 4 EVENING

   They talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.--PSA. 69:26.

   I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.

   Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual,
   restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself,
   lest thou also be tempted.

   He which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a
   soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.--Comfort the
   feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.

   Let us not . . . judge one another any more: but judge this rather,
   that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his
   brother's way.--We . . . that are strong ought to bear the infirmities
   of the weak and not to please ourelves.

   Charity . . . rejoiceth not in iniquity.--Let him that thinketh he
   standeth take heed lest he fall.

   FEBRUARY 5 MORNING

   I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more
   abundantly.--JOHN 10:10.

   In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.--She took of
   the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with
   her; and he did eat.

   The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through
   Jesus Christ our Lord.--If by one man's offence death reigned by one;
   much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of
   righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.--Since by man
   came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in
   Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.--Our Saviour
   Jesus Christ, . . . hath abolished death, and hath brought life and
   immortality to light through the gospel.

   God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that
   hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not
   life.--For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world;
   but that the world through him might be saved.

   Gen. 2:17. -Gen. 3:6.Rom. 6:23. -Rom. 5:17. -I Cor. 15:21,22. -II Tim. 1:10.I John 5:11,12. -John 3:17.
     __________________________________________________________________

   FEBRUARY 5 EVENING

   The judgment-seat.--II COR. 5:10.

   We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth.--When the
   Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him,
   then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be
   gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a
   shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats.

   Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of
   their Father.--Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It
   is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that
   died, yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand
   of God, who also maketh intercession for us.--There is therefore now no
   condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.

   We are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the
   world.

   Rom. 2:2. -Matt. 25:31,32.Matt. 13:43. -Rom. 8:33,34. -Rom. 8:1.I Cor. 11:32.
     __________________________________________________________________

   FEBRUARY 6 MORNING

   The grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which
   is in Christ Jesus.--I TIM. 1:14.

   Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich,
   yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might
   become rich.--For where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.

   That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his
   grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are
   ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of
   God: not of works, lest any man should boast.--Knowing that a man is
   not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus
   Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be
   justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for
   by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.--According to his
   mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the
   Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
   Saviour.

   II Cor. 8:9. -Rom. 5:20.Eph. 2:7-9. -Gal. 2:16. -Tit. 3:5,6.

   FEBRUARY 6 EVENING

   I am . . . the bright and morning Star.--REV. 22:16.

   There shall come a star out of Jacob.

   The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off
   the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.--Until
   the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou
   like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bethel.

   Watchman, what of the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh, and
   also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.

   I am the light of the world.--I will give him the morning star.

   Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. For the
   Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and
   gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and
   commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye therefore: . . . lest coming
   suddenly he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you I say unto all,
   Watch.

   FEBRUARY 7 MORNING

   When thou has eaten and are full, . . . thou shalt bless the Lord thy
   God for the good land which he hath given thee.--DEUT. 8:10.

   Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God.--One of them, when he saw
   that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,
   and fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a
   Samaritan. And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but
   where are the nine? There are not found that returned to give glory to
   God, save this stranger.

   Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be
   received with thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the word of God and
   prayer.--He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God
   thanks.--The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no
   sorrow with it.

   Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy
   name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, . . . who forgiveth all thine
   iniquities; . . . who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender
   mercies.

   FEBRUARY 7 EVENING

   Jesus . . . was moved with compassion toward them.--MATT. 14:14.

   Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and for ever.--We have not
   an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
   infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
   sin.--Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out
   of the way.--He cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto
   Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? Watch ye
   and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but
   the flesh is weak.

   Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that
   fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

   Thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
   longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. O turn unto me, and
   have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the
   son of thine handmaid.

   Heb. 13:8. -Heb. 4:15. -Heb. 5:2. -Mark 14:37,38.Psa. 103:13,14.Psa. 86:15,16.

   FEBRUARY 8 MORNING

   Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what
   his lord doeth: but I have called you friends.--JOHN 15:15.

   The Lord said, shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?--It is
   given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.--God
   hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all
   things, yea, the deep things of God.--Even the hidden wisdom, which God
   ordained before the world unto our glory.

   Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto
   thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the
   goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.--The secret of the Lord
   is with them that fear him: and he will shew them his covenant.--I have
   given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received
   them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have
   believed that thou didst send me.

   Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.

   FEBRUARY 8 EVENING

   Thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.--ISA. 60:18.

   The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of
   the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

   Ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the
   saints, and of the household of God, and are built upon the foundation
   of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief
   corner stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth
   unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded together
   for an habitation of God through the Spirit.--If so be ye have tasted
   that the Lord is gracious. To whom coming, as unto a living stone,
   disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also, as
   lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to
   offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

   Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion.

   Now he is comforted.--LUKE 16:25.

   Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself:
   for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy
   mourning shall be ended.--He will swallow up death in victory; and the
   Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his
   people shall he take away from off all the earth.--These are they which
   came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made
   them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the
   throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that
   sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no
   more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor
   any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed
   them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters.--God shall
   wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death,
   neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for
   the former things are passed away.

   FEBRUARY 9 EVENING

   The night cometh when no man can work.--JOHN 9:4.

   Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, . . . they . . . rest from
   their labours; and their works do follow them.--There the wicked cease
   from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.--Samuel said to Saul,
   Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?

   Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is
   no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither
   thou goest.--The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down
   into silence.

   I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
   I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the
   faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
   which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day.

   There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is
   entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God
   did from his.

   FEBRUARY 10 MORNING

   The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single
   thy whole body also is full of light.--LUKE 11:34.

   The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they
   are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are
   spiritually discerned.--Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous
   things out of thy law.

   I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in
   darkness, but shall have the light of life.--We all, with open face
   beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the
   same image . . . even as by the Spirit of the Lord.--God, who commanded
   the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give
   the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
   Christ.

   The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, give unto you
   the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: . . . that

   glory of his inheritance in the saints.

   FEBRUARY 10 EVENING

   He smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
   overflowed.--PSA. 78:20.

   All our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
   and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and did
   all eat the same spiritual meat; and did all drink the same spiritual
   drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and
   that rock was Christ.--One of the soldiers with a spear pierced his
   side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.--He was wounded for
   our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement
   of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

   Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.--My people have
   committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living
   waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no

   They that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord
   harkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before
   him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his
   name.--MAL. 3:16.

   It came to pass that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus
   himself drew near, and went with them.--Where two or three are gathered
   together in my name, there am I in the midst ot them.--My
   fellow-labourers, whose names are in the book of life.

   Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and
   admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
   singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.--Exhort one another
   daily, while it is called to-day; lest any of you be hardened through
   the deceitfulness of sin.

   Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof
   in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and

   be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by
   the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be

   cease from yielding fruit.

   I the Lord have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree,
   have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish.

   The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a

   word. I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which

   thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. Father, I will that they

   I will come again, and receive you unto myself.--He shall come to be

   FEBRUARY 12 EVENING

   I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.--EXO. 33:18.

   God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in
   our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in
   the face of Jesus Christ.--The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us,
   (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the
   Father,) full of grace and truth . . . No man hath seen God at any
   time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he
   hath declared him.

   My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and
   appear before God?--When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said
   unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.

   We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
   are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the
   Spirit of the Lord.--Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast

   FEBRUARY 13 MORNING

   Upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a
   man above upon it.--EZEK. 1:26.

   The man Christ Jesus.--Made in the likeness of men . . . found in
   fashion as a man.--Forasmuch . . . as the children are partakers of
   flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that
   through death he might destroy him that had the power of death.

   I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for
   evermore.--Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath
   no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once:
   but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.--What and if ye shall see
   the Son of Man ascend up where he was before?--He raised him from the
   dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.--In him
   dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.

   Though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of
   God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the
   power of God.

   I Tim. 2:5. -Phi. 2:7,8. -Heb. 2:14.Rev. 1:18. -Rom. 6:9,10. -John 6:62. -Eph. 1:20. -Col. 2:9.II Cor. 13:4.

   FEBRUARY 13 EVENING

   Thy word hath quickened me.--PSA. 119:50.

   The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a
   quickening spirit.

   As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have
   life in himself.--I am the resurrection, and the life: he that
   believeth in me though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever
   liveth and believeth in me shall never die.

   In him was life; and the life was the light of men . . . As many as
   received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
   them that believe on his name: which were born, not of blood, nor of
   the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

   It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the
   words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.--The
   word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged
   sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of
   the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents
   of the heart.

   I Cor. 15:45.John 5:26. -John 11:25,26.John 1:4,12,13.John 6:63. -Heb. 4:12.

   FEBRUARY 14 MORNING

   Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all
   righteousness.--MATT. 3:15.

   I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.

   Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not
   come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven
   and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the
   law, till all be fulfilled.--The Lord is well pleased for his
   righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it
   honourable.--Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness
   of the scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom
   of heaven.

   What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God
   sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
   condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be
   fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
   Spirit.--Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one
   that believeth.

   Psa. 40:8.Matt. 5:17,18. -Isa. 42:21. -Matt. 5:20.Rom. 8:3,4. -Rom. 10:4.

   FEBRUARY 14 EVENING 1 am thy part and thine inheritance.--NUM. 18:20.

   Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I
   desire beside thee. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the
   strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.--The LORD is the portion
   of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. The lines
   are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.

   The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.

   Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the
   rejoicing of my heart.

   O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for
   thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no
   water is . . . Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow
   of thy wings will I rejoice.

   My beloved is mine, and I am his.

   Psa. 73:25,26. -Psa. 16:5,6.Lam. 3:24.Psa. 119:111.Psa. 63:1,7.Song 2:16.
     __________________________________________________________________

   FEBRUARY 15 MORNING

   Who can say, I have made my heart clean?--PROV. 20:9.

   The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if
   there were any that did understand, and seek God. They are all gone
   aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth
   good, no, not one.--They that are in the flesh cannot please God.

   To will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I
   find not. For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I
   would not, that I do.--We are all as an unclean thing, and all our
   righteousnesses are as filthy rags: and we all do fade as a leaf: and
   our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

   The scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith
   of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.--God was in
   Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their
   trespasses unto them.

   If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is
   not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
   us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

   Psa. 14:2,3. -Rom. 8:8.Rom. 7:18,19. -Isa. 64:6.Gal. 3:22. -II Cor. 5:19.I John 1:8,9.

   FEBRUARY 15 EVENING

   The floods lift up their waves.--PSA. 93:3.

   The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than
   the mighty waves of the sea.--O Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord
   like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee? thou rulest
   the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest
   them.

   Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye not tremble at my presence,
   which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual
   decree, that it cannot pass it?

   When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through
   the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.

   Peter . . . walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the
   wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried,
   saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand,
   and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore
   didst thou doubt?

   What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

   Psa 93:4. -Psa. 89:8,9.Jer. 5:22.Isa.43:2.Matt. 14:29-31.Psa. 56:3.

   FEBRUARY 16 MORNING

   Thy name is as ointment poured forth.--SONG 1:3.

   Christ . . . hath loved us, and hath given himself for us, an offering
   and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.--Unto you therefore
   which believe he is precious.--God also hath highly exalted him, and
   given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus
   every knee should bow.--In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead
   bodily.

   If ye love me, keep my commandments.--The love of God is shed abroad in
   our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.--The house was
   filled with the odour of the ointment.--They took knowledge of them,
   that they had been with Jesus.

   O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast
   set thy glory above the heavens.--Emmanuel . . . God with us.--His name
   shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting
   Father, The Prince of Peace.--The name of the Lord is a strong tower:
   the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.

   FEBRUARY 16 EVENING

   We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened.--II COR. 5:4.

   Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from
   thee . . . Mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden
   they are too heavy for me.--O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver
   me from the body of this death?

   The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
   And not only they, but ourselves . . . which have the firstfruits of
   the Spirit . . . groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption, to
   wit, the redemption of our body.--Now for a season, if need be, ye are
   in heaviness through manifold temptations.

   Shortly I must put off this my tabernacle.--For this corruptible must
   put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality. So when
   this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall
   have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that
   is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

   Psa. 38:9,4. -Rom. 7:24.Rom. 8:22,23. -I Pet. 1:6.II Pet. 1:14. -I Cor. 15:53,54.

   FEBRUARY 17 MORNING

   The whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean
   place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with
   fire.--LEV. 4:12.

   They took Jesus, and led him away. And he bearing his cross went forth
   into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew
   Golgotha: where they crucified him.--The bodies of those beasts, whose
   blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are
   burned without the camp. Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify
   the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. Let us go
   forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.--The
   fellowship of his sufferings.

   Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings: that,
   when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding
   joy.--Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a
   far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.

   FEBRUARY 17 EVENING

   God created man in his own image.--GEN. 1:27.

   Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think
   that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art
   and man's device.

   God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
   even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ.
   We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which
   God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.--For whom he did
   foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his
   Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

   We know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall
   see him as he is.--I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy
   likeness.

   He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
   he shall be my son.--If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and
   joint-heirs with Christ.

   FEBRUARY 18 MORNING

   Thou art my hope in the day of evil.--JER. 17:17.

   There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up
   the light of thy countenance upon us.--I will sing of thy power; yea I
   will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning; for thou hast been my
   defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.

   In my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. Thou didst hide thy
   face, and I was troubled. I cried to thee, O Lord: and unto the Lord I
   made supplication. What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to
   the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? Hear,
   O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper.

   For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I
   gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment;
   but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord
   thy Reeemer.--Sorrow shall be turned into joy.--Weeping may endure for
   a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

   FEBRUARY 18 EVENING

   Adam . . . begat a son in his own likeness.--GEN. 5:3.

   Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?--Behold, I was shapen in
   iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.

   Dead in trespasses and sins; . . . by nature the children of wrath,
   even as others.--I am carnal, sold under sin. That which I do I allow
   not; for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. I
   know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing.

   By one man sin entered into the world, . . . by one man's disobedience
   many were made sinners.--If through the offence of one many be dead,
   much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man,
   Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.

   The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from
   the law of sin and death.

   Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   FEBRUARY 19 MORNING

   The Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and
   understanding.--PROV. 2:6.

   Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own
   understanding.--If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God, that
   giveth to all men liberally and upbradeth not; and it shall be given
   him.--The foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God
   is stronger than men.--God hath chosen the foolish things of the world
   to confound the wise. That no flesh should glory in his presence.

   The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto
   the simple.--Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin
   against thee.

   All bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which
   proceeded out of his mouth.--Never man spake like this man.--Of him are
   ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and
   righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.

   The year of my redeemed is come.--ISA. 63:4.

   Ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all
   the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto
   you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, . . . and unto
   his family.

   Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise.
   Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of
   herbs and the earth shall cast out the dead.

   The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice
   of the archangel and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ
   shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
   together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
   shall we ever be with the Lord.

   I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from
   death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy
   destruction.

   Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name.

   FEBRUARY 20 MORNING

   He shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied.--ISA. 53:11.

   Jesus . . . said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up
   the ghost.--He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we
   might be made the righteousness of God in him.

   This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my
   praise.--To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in
   heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of
   God, according to the eternal purpose which be purposed in Christ Jesus
   our Lord.--That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches
   of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

   After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of
   promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption
   of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.--Ye are a
   chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar
   people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called
   you out of darkness into his marvellous light.

   FEBRUARY 20 EVENING

   The day of temptation in the wilderness.--HEB. 3:8.

   Let no man say, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot
   be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is
   tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when
   lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.

   They lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the
   desert.

   Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost was led by the Spirit into the
   wilderness, being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he
   did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. And
   the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone
   that it be made bread.

   He himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that
   are tempted.--Simon, Simon, . . . Satan hath desired to have you, that
   he might sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee that thy faith
   fail not.

   FEBRUARY 21 MORNING

   I am the Lord which sanctify you.--LEV. 20:8.

   I am the Lord your God, which have separated you from other people. And
   ye shall be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you
   from other people, that ye should be mine.

   Sanctified by God the Father.--Sanctify them through thy truth: thy
   word is truth.--The very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray
   God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Jesus . . . that he might sanctify the people with his own blood,
   suffered without the gate.--Our Saviour Jesus Christ . . . gave himself
   for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto
   himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.--Both he that
   sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause
   he is not ashamed to call them brethren.--For their sakes I sanctify
   myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.--Through
   sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience, and sprinkling of the
   blood of Jesus Christ.

   They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and
   weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with
   rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.

   That which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be.

   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according
   to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the
   resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Wherein ye greatly rejoice,
   though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through
   manifold temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much more
   precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire,

   What man is he that feareth the Lord? him shall he teach in the way
   that he shall choose.--PSA. 25:12.

   The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single thy
   whole body shall be full of light.

   Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.--Thine ears
   shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it,
   when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.--I will
   instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will
   guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse or as the mule, which
   have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle,
   lest they come near unto thee. Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but
   he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about. Be glad in
   the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are
   upright in heart.

   O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man
   that walketh to direct his steps.

   When thou liest down, thou shall not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie
   down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.--PROV. 3:24.

   There arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so
   that it was now full. And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep
   on a pillow.

   Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication
   with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the
   peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts
   and minds through Christ Jesus.

   I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, Lord, only
   makest me dwell in safety.--He giveth his beloved sleep.

   They stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive
   my spirit. And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay
   not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell
   asleep.--Absent from the body, . . . present with the Lord.

   FEBRUARY 23 MORNING

   The blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of
   Abel.--HEB. 12:24.

   Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.--The
   Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.--It is not possible that
   the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. Wherefore when
   he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou
   wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me. By the which will we
   are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once
   for all.

   Abel, . . . brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat
   thereof . . . The Lord had respect unto Abel and to his
   offering.--Christ . . . hath loved us, and hath given himself for us,
   an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.

   Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having
   our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed
   with pure water.--Having . . . boldness to enter into the holiest by
   the blood of Jesus.

   FEBRUARY 23 EVENING

   Who knoweth the power of thine anger?--PSA. 90:11.

   From the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth
   hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
   saying,Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why
   hast thou forsaken me?--The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us
   all.

   There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
   Jesus.--Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
   Lord Jesus Christ.--Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law,
   being made a curse for us.

   God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live
   through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved
   us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.--That he
   might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

   Matt. 27:45,46. -Isa. 53:6.Rom. 8:1. -Rom. 5:1. -Gal. 3:13.I John 4:9,10. -Rom. 3:26.

   FEBRUARY 24 MORNING

   Thus saith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of.--EZEK. 36:37.

   Ye have not, because ye ask not.

   Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
   shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he
   that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be
   opened.--This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask
   anything according to his will, he heareth us: and if we know that he
   hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we
   desired of him.--If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that
   giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given
   him.--Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.--Men ought always to
   pray, and not to faint.

   The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto
   their cry. The Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their
   troubles.--Ye shall ask in my name; and I say not unto you, that I will
   pray the Father for you: for the Father himself loveth you, because ye
   have loved me. Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.

   Jas. 4:2.Matt. 7:7,8. -I John 5:14,15. -Jas. 1:5. -Psa. 81:10. -Luke 18:1.Psa. 34:15,17. -John 16:26,27,24.

   FEBRUARY 24 EVENING

   Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive
   evil?--JOB 2:10.

   I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
   faithfulness hast afflicted me.--O Lord, thou art our father, we are
   the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.--It
   is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good.

   Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk
   with thee of thy judgments.

   He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver.--Whom the Lord loveth
   he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.--It is enough
   for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his
   lord.--Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
   which he suffered.

   Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that,
   when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding
   joy.--These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have
   washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

   FEBRUARY 25 MORNING

   Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.--JAS. 4:7.

   When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall
   lift up a standard against him.--Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
   written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou
   serve. Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and
   ministered unto him.

   Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole
   armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the
   devil.--And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
   but rather reprove them.--Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for
   we are not ignorant of his devices.--Be sober, be vigilant; because
   your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking
   whom he may devour; whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the
   same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the
   world.--This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.

   Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that
   justifieth.

   FEBRUARY 25 EVENING

   Oh that I knew where I might find him!--JOB 23:3.

   Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his
   servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in
   the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.

   Ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all
   your heart.--Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened
   unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
   findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

   Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus
   Christ.--Now in Christ Jesus ye who sometime were far off are made nigh
   by the blood of Christ. For through him we both have access by one
   Spirit unto the Father.

   If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we
   lie, and do not the truth.

   Lo, I am with you alway.--I will never leave thee, nor forsake
   thee.--The Comforter . . . dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.

   Isa. 50:10.Jer. 29:13. -Luke 11:9,10.I John 1:3. -Eph. 2:13,18.I John 1:6.Matt. 28:20. -Heb. 13:5. -John 14:16,17.

   FEBRUARY 26 MORNING

   Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord.--LAM. 3:40.

   Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.--Behold,
   thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou
   shalt make me to know wisdom.--I thought on my ways, and turned my feet
   unto thy testimonies. I made haste and delayed not to keep thy
   commandments.--Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that
   bread, and drink of that cup.

   If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
   and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.--We have an advocate with
   the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for
   our sins.--Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the
   holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he hath
   consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh: and
   having a high priest over the house of God; let us draw near with a
   true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled
   from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.

   FEBRUARY 26 EVENING

   There was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an
   emerald.--REV. 4:3.

   This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and
   every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: I do
   set my bow in the cloud,. . . and I will look upon it, that I may
   remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature
   of all flesh that is upon the earth.--An everlasting covenant, ordered
   in all things and sure.--That by two immutable things, in which it was
   impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have
   fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.

   We declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made
   unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto their children, in
   that He hath raised up Jesus again.

   Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and for ever.

   Gen. 9:12,13,16. -II Sam. 23:5. -Heb. 6:18.Acts. 13:32.Heb. 13:8.

   FEBRUARY 27 MORNING

   Reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God
   through Jesus Christ our Lord.--ROM. 6:11.

   He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath
   everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed
   from death unto life.--I through the law am dead to the law, that I
   might live unto God. I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live;
   yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in
   the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave
   himself for me.

   Because I live, ye shall live also.--I give unto them eternal life: and
   they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my
   hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is
   able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. I and my Father are one.

   If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,
   where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God . . . For ye are dead,
   and your life is hid with Christ in God.

   John 5:24. -Gal. 2:19,20.John 14:19. -John 10:28-30.Col. 3:1,3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   FEBRUARY 27 EVENING

   God . . . giveth . . . liberally, and upbraideth not.--JAS. 1:5.

   Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She
   said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee:
   go, and sin no more.

   The grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus
   Christ, hath abounded unto many . . . The free gift is of many offences
   unto justification.

   God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
   even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ,
   (by grace ye are saved) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit
   together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come
   he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward
   us through Christ Jesus.

   He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how
   shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

   John 8:10-11.Rom. 5:15,16.Eph. 2:4-7.Rom. 8:32.
     __________________________________________________________________

   FEBRUARY 28 MORNING

   God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
   whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life.--JOHN 3:16.

   God . . . hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given
   to us the ministry of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ,
   reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto
   them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then
   we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we
   pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made
   him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
   righteousness of God in him.

   God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because
   that God sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live
   through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved
   us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if
   God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.

   II Cor. 5:18-21. -I John 4:8-11.
     __________________________________________________________________

   FEBRUARY 28 EVENING

   The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.--PROV. 20:27.

   He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her . .
   . And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience,
   went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last.

   Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree,
   whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?

   To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.--If
   our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all
   things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
   toward God.

   All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with
   offence. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he
   alloweth.

   Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and
   see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way
   everlasting.

   John 8:7,9.Gen. 3:11.Jas. 4:17. -I John 3:20,21.Rom. 14:20,22.Psa. 139:23,24.
     __________________________________________________________________

   FEBRUARY 29 MORNING

   Boast not thyself of tomorrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
   bring forth.--PROV. 27:1.

   Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of
   salvation.--Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye
   have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in
   darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have light, believe in
   the light, that ye may be the children of light.

   Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is
   no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither
   thou goest.

   Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease,
   eat, drink, and be merry . . . Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be
   required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast
   provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich
   toward God.

   What is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little
   time, and then vanisheth away.--The world passeth away, and the lust
   thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.

   Thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.--PSA. 102:27.

   Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the
   earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art
   God.

   I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
   consumed.--The same yesterday, and today, and forever.

   Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down
   from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow
   of turning.--The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

   God is not a man, that he should lie: neither the son of man, that he
   should repent.--It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed,
   because his compassions fail not.

   This man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
   Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto
   God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.--Fear
   not; I am the first and the last.

   MARCH 1 MORNING

   The fruit of the Spirit is love.--GAL. 5:22.

   God is love: and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in
   him.--The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
   which is given unto us.--Unto you . . . which believe he is
   precious.--We love him, because he first loved us.--The love of Christ
   constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then
   were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should
   not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them,
   and rose again.

   Ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.--This is my
   commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.--Above all
   things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover
   the multitude of sins.--Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and
   hath given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a
   sweetsmelling savour.

   Jehovah-nissi: The Lord my banner.--EXO. 17:15.

   If God be for us, who can be against us?--The Lord is on my side; I
   will not fear: what can man do unto me?

   Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee. The Lord is my light
   and my salvation; whom shall I fear?

   The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? Though
   an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war
   should rise against me, in this will I be confident.

   Behold, God himself is with us for our captain.--The Lord of hosts is
   with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.

   These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them.

   Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? He that
   sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in
   derision.--Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak
   the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.

   MARCH 2 MORNING

   God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.--GEN. 41:52.

   Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
   mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our
   tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any
   trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
   For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also
   aboundeth by Christ.

   Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold
   temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much more precious
   than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be
   found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus
   Christ.--The Lord stood with me, and strengthened me.

   Let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of
   their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.

   MARCH 2 EVENING

   There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.--HEB. 4:9.

   There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
   There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the
   oppressor.

   Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth; they . . .
   rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.

   Our friend Lazarus sleepeth . . . Jesus spake of his death: but they
   thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.

   We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened.--Ourselves
   also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan
   within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of
   our body. For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope .
   . . But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait
   for it.

   MARCH 3 MORNING

   Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own
   understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
   paths.--PROV. 3:5,6.

   Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him:
   God is a refuge for us.

   I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I
   will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule,
   which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and
   bridle, lest they come near unto thee. Many sorrows shall be to the
   wicked: but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him
   about.--Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the
   way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to
   the left.

   If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. For wherein
   shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy
   sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated,
   I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the
   earth.

   Thou shalt have treasure in heaven: . . . come and follow me.--I am . .
   . thy exceeding great reward.

   Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over
   a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into
   the joy of thy lord.--They shall reign for ever and ever.

   Ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.--The crown of
   life.--A crown of righteousness.--An incorruptible crown.

   Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me
   where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou has given me.--So

   MARCH 4 MORNING

   Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.--COL. 3:2.

   Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any
   man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.--Lay not up
   for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt,
   and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves
   treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and
   where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure
   is, there will your heart be also.

   We walk by faith, not by sight.--We faint not; but though our outward
   man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light
   affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
   exceeding and eternal weight of glory: while we look not at the things
   which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things
   which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are
   eternal.--An inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth
   not away, reserved in heaven for you.

   He bowed his shoulder to bear.--GEN. 49:15.

   Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the
   Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.--Now all
   these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for
   our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.

   Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive
   evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.--Aaron held his
   peace.--It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good.

   Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee.--Surely he
   hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.

   Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
   you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
   lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is

   O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me.--ISA. 38:14.

   Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
   Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters,
   and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes
   wait upon the Lord our God.--Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
   From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is
   overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. For thou hast
   been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy. I will abide
   in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy
   wings.--Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy
   in his distress, a refuge from the storms.

   Christ . . . suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should
   follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
   who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he
   threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.

   Fight the good fight of faith.--I TIM. 6:12.

   We were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were
   fears.--Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be
   with them.--Strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.

   Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield:
   but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the
   armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.--God is my strength and power:
   . . . he teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by
   mine arms.--Our sufficiency is of God.

   The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and
   delivereth them.--Behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots
   of fire round about Elisha.

   The time would fail me to tell of [those] who through faith subdued
   kingdoms, . . . out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in
   fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.

   MARCH 6 MORNING

   He preserveth the way of his saints.--PROV. 2:8.

   The Lord your God . . . went in the way before you, to search you out a
   place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way
   ye should go, and in a cloud by day.--As an eagle stirreth up her nest,
   fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them,
   beareth them on her wings: so the Lord alone did lead him.--The steps
   of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way.
   Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord
   upholdeth him with his hand.--Many are the afflictions of the
   righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.--For the Lord
   knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall
   perish.--We know that all things work together for good to them that
   love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.--With us
   is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our battles.

   the Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will
   rejoice over thee with joy.

   MARCH 6 EVENING

   My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?--MATT. 27:46.

   He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
   iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; . . . the Lord
   hath laid on him the iniquity of us all . . . For the transgression of
   my people was he stricken . . . It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he
   hath put him to grief.

   Jesus our Lord . . . was delivered for our offences.--Christ hath once
   suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to
   God.--Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that
   we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose
   stripes ye were healed.

   He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be
   made the righteousness of God in him.

   Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse
   for us.

   Isa. 53:5,6,8,10.Rom. 4:24,25. -I Pet. 3:18. -I Pet. 2:24.II Cor. 5:21.Gal. 3:13.

   MARCH 7 MORNING

   Thy Maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is his name.--ISA. 54:5.

   This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.

   Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken . . . but thou shalt be called
   Hephzibah, . . . for the Lord delighteth in thee. And as the bridegroom
   rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.--He hath
   sent me . . . to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that
   mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for
   mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.

   I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God;
   for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, as a bridegroom
   decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with
   her jewels.

   I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me
   in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness and in
   mercies.

   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

   MARCH 7 EVENING

   My times are in thy hand.--PSA. 31:15.

   All his saints are in thy hand.--The word of the Lord came unto Elijah,
   saying, Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the
   brook Cherith, that is before Jordan. And it shall be, that thou shalt
   drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
   And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, Arise, get thee to
   Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have
   commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.

   Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
   drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Your heavenly
   Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

   Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own
   understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
   paths.--Casting all your care upon him; for he cares for you.

   Deut. 33:3. -I Kgs. 17:2-4,8,9.Matt. 6:25,32.Prov. 3:5,6. -I Pet. 5:7.

   MARCH 8 MORNING

   Thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.--ISA. 38:17.

   Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by
   the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his
   anger forever, because he delighteth in mercy. He will turn again, he
   will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou
   wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.

   For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I
   gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment;
   but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord
   thy Redeemer.--I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their
   sin no more.

   Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
   Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in
   whose spirit there is no guile.--The blood of Jesus Christ his Son
   cleanseth us from all sin.

   MARCH 8 EVENING

   I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able.--II TIM. 1:12.

   Able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

   Able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all
   sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.

   Able to succour them that are tempted.

   Able . . . to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him,
   seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.

   Able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the
   presence of his glory with exceeding joy.

   Able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.

   Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his
   glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to
   subdue all things unto himself.

   Believe ye that I am able to do this? . . . Yea, Lord. According to
   your faith be it unto you.

   MARCH 9 MORNING

   The living God giveth us richly all things to enjoy.--I TIM. 6:17.

   Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his
   commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee
   this day: lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly
   houses, and dwelt therein; . . . then thine heart be lifted up, and
   thou forget the Lord thy God: . . . for it is he that giveth thee power
   to get wealth.

   Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it:
   except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. It is
   vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of
   sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.--They got not the land in
   possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but
   thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance,
   because thou hadst a favour unto them--There be many that say, Who will
   shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon
   us.

   MARCH 9 EVENING

   They sang as it were a new song.--REV. 14:3.

   A new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us.--Not by works
   of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he
   saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
   Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
   Saviour.--By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
   yourselves: it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should
   boast.

   Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory.--Unto
   him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in own blood, and hath
   made us kings and priests unto God and Father; to him be glory and
   dominion for ever and ever. Amen.--Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed
   us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people,
   and nation.--I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could
   number, . . . cried . . . saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth
   upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.

   The Lord will provide.--GEN. 22:14.

   God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.

   Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither
   his ear heavy, that it cannot hear.--There shall come out of Sion the
   Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.

   Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in
   the Lord his God.--Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear
   him, upon them that hope in his mercy; to deliver their soul from
   death.

   My God shall supply all your need, according to his riches in glory by
   Christ Jesus.--He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
   So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear
   what man shall do unto me.--The Lord is my strength and my shield; my
   heart trusteth in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly
   rejoiceth: and with my song will I praise him.

   will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.

   If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have
   kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.

   Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.--I am
   come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh
   with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey.--The fruit of
   the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
   faith, meekness, temperance.

   Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be
   my disciples.--Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it
   may bring forth more fruit.--Being filled with the fruits of

   it.--Thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou
   compass him as with a shield.

   He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not
   slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor
   sleep. The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right

   soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this
   time forth, and even for evermore.--I the Lord do keep it; I will water
   it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.

   Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me.
   While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that
   thou gavest me I have kept.

   Jesus wept.--JOHN 11:35.

   A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.--We have not an high
   priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.--It
   became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in
   bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation
   perfect through sufferings.--Though he were a Son, yet learned he
   obedience by the things which he suffered.

   I was not rebellious, neither turned away back. I gave my back to the
   smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my
   face from shame and spitting.

   Behold how he loved.--He took not on him the nature of angels; but he
   took on him the seed of Abraham. In all things it behooved him to be
   made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful
   high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the
   sins of the people.

   The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee. The

   No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in
   the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.--The brightness of his
   glory, and the express image of his person.--The god of this world hath
   blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the
   glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto
   them.

   Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies sake.
   Let me not be ashamed, O Lord; for I have called upon thee.--Lord, by
   thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide
   thy face, and I was troubled.--Blessed is the people that know the
   joyful sound: they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.

   The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his
   people with peace.

   Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.

   Things that are pleasing in his sight.--I JOHN 3:22.

   Without faith it is impossible to please him.--So then they that are in
   the flesh cannot please God.--The Lord taketh pleasure in his people.

   This is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief,
   suffering wrongfully. If, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take
   it patiently, this is acceptable with God.--The ornament of a meek and
   quiet spirit, . . . is in the sight of God of great price.

   Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his
   conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.--I will praise
   the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
   This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath
   horns and hoofs.

   I beseech you, . . . brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present
   your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is
   your reasonable service.

   There is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man Christ

   Forasmuch . . . as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he
   also himself likewise took part of the same.

   Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God,
   and there is none else.

   We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.--In
   Christ Jesus, ye who sometime were far off, are made nigh by the blood
   of Christ. For he is our peace.--By his own blood he entered in once
   into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. And for
   this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of
   death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the
   first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of
   eternal inheritance.--He is able also to save them to the uttermost
   that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession
   for them.

   O my God, my soul is cast down within me.--PSA. 42:6.

   Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee:
   because he trusteth in thee. Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the
   Lord JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.

   Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee.--He hath not
   despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he
   hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.--Is any
   among you afflicted? let him pray.

   Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.--Take no
   thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor
   yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Behold the fowls of the air:
   for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your
   heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?--Be not
   faithless, but believing.--Lo, I am with you alway.

   MARCH 14 MORNING

   Adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.--TIT. 2:10.

   Let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ.--Abstain
   from all appearance of evil.--If ye be reproached for the name of
   Christ, happy are ye. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a
   thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.--Be
   blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst
   of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the
   world.--Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
   works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

   Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write
   them upon the table of thine heart; so shalt thou find favour and good
   understanding in the sight of God and man.--Brethren, whatsoever things
   are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,
   whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
   things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any

   The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are

   Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth.--The letter
   killeth, but the spirit giveth life.

   Christ . . . loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might
   sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he
   might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or
   wrinkle, or any such thing.

   Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto
   according to thy word. Thy word hath quickened me. Thy word have I hid
   in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. I will not forget thy
   word. I trust in thy word. The law of thy mouth is better unto me than
   thousands of gold and silver. I will never forget thy precepts: for
   with them thou hast quickened me. How sweet are thy words unto my
   taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth! Through thy precepts I get
   understanding: therefore I hate every false way.

   MARCH 15 MORNING

   Perfect through sufferings.--HEB. 2:10.

   My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry here, and watch
   with me. And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and
   prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from
   me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.--And being in an
   agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great
   drops of blood falling down to the ground.

   The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon
   me: I found trouble and sorrow.--Reproach hath broken my heart; and I
   am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was
   none; and for comforters, but I found none.--I looked on my right hand,
   and behold, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me;
   no man cared for my soul.

   He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted
   with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised,
   and we esteemed him not.

   MARCH 15 EVENING

   The Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is.--EXO. 20:11.

   The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his
   handywork.--By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the
   host of them by the breath of his mouth. For he spake, and it was done;
   he commanded, and it stood fast.--Behold, the nations are as a drop of
   a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he
   taketh up the isles as a very little thing.

   Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of
   God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do
   appear.

   When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the
   stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of
   him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?

   MARCH 16 MORNING

   What is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little
   time, and then vanisheth away.--JAS. 4:14.

   My days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. They
   are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the
   prey.--Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep . .
   . in the morning they are like grass which groweth up. In the morning
   it flourisheth, and groweth up: in the evening it is cut down, and
   withereth.--Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of
   trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down.

   The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the
   will of God abideth for ever.--They shall perish, but thou shalt
   endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture
   shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the
   same, and thy years shall have no end.--Jesus Christ, the same
   yesterday, and today, and forever.

   I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding
   also.--I COR. 14:15.

   Be filled with the Spirit, speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns
   and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the
   Lord.--Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom;
   teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual
   songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

   My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless
   his holy name for ever and ever.

   Praise ye the Lord: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it
   is pleasant; and praise is comely. Sing unto the Lord with
   thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God.

   I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the
   voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping with
   their harps.

   He shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall
   be accepted for him to make atonement for him.--LEV. 1:4.

   Ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver
   and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your
   fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
   blemish and without spot.--Who his own self bare our sins in his own
   body on the tree.

   He hath made us accepted in the beloved. As lively stones, . . . built
   up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
   sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.--I beseech you
   therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies
   a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
   service.

   Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you
   faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the
   only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power,
   both now and ever.

   MARCH 17 EVENING

   In all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.--HEB. 4:15.

   When the woman saw that the tree was good for food (the lust of the
   flesh), and that it was pleasant to the eyes (the lust of the eyes),
   and a tree to be desired to make one wise (the pride of life), she took
   of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with
   her; and he did eat.

   When the tempter came to [Jesus], he said, if thou be the Son of God,
   command that these stones be made bread (the lust of the flesh). But he
   answered, . . . Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word
   that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. The devil . . . sheweth him
   all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them (the lust of the
   eyes, and the pride of life). Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee
   hence, Satan.

   In that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour
   them that are tempted.

   Blessed is the man that endureth temptation.

   Gen. 3:6.Matt. 4:3,4,8-10. -Heb. 2:18.Jas. 1:12.

   Mine eyes fail with looking upward.--ISA. 38:14.

   Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak: O Lord, heal me; for my
   bones are vexed. My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how
   long? Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies'
   sake.--My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are
   fallen upon me. Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror
   hath overwhelmed me. And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for
   then would I fly away, and be at rest.

   Ye have need of patience.

   While they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two
   men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee,
   why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up
   from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him
   go into heaven.--Our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we
   look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.--That blessed hope,. . .
   the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.

   His name shall be in their foreheads.--REV. 22:4.

   I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep.--The foundation of God
   standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.
   And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.

   The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth
   them that trust in him.--Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the
   trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.

   After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of
   promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance.--Now he which
   stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who
   hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.

   I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of
   my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my
   God: and I will write upon him my new name.--This is the name wherewith
   she shall be called, The Lord our Righteousness.

   God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in the
   turning away every one of you from his iniquities.--ACTS 3:26.

   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according
   to his abundant mercies hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by
   the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.--Saved by his life.

   Our Saviour Jesus Christ . . . who gave himself for us that he might
   redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people,
   zealous of good works.--As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye
   holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy
   for I am holy.

   The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, . . . hath blessed us with
   all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.--In him dwelleth
   all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him.--Of
   his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.

   He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how
   shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

   Strengthen thou me according unto thy word.--PSA. 119:28.

   Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou has caused me to
   hope.--O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me.

   Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.--Ye
   know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath
   failed of all the good things which the Lord your God spake concerning
   you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed
   thereof.

   Fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he
   had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak;
   for thou hast strengthened me.--Be strong, . . . and work: for I am
   with you, saith the Lord of hosts.--Not by might nor by power, but by
   my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.

   Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.

   The entrance of thy words giveth light.--PSA. 119:130.

   This . . . is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto
   you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.--God, who
   commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our
   hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
   face of Jesus Christ.--The Word was God. In him was life; and the life
   was the light of men.--If we walk in the light, as he is in the light,
   we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his
   Son cleanseth us from all sin.

   Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against
   thee.--Ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.

   Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as
   children of light.--Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a
   holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises
   of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.

   Noah was a just man.--GEN. 6:9.

   The just shall live by faith.--Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and
   took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt
   offerings on the altar. And the Lord smelled a sweet savour.--The Lamb
   slain from the foundation of the world.

   Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight:
   for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of
   God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the
   prophets; even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus
   Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no
   difference.

   We . . . joy in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now
   received the atonement.

   Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect ? It is God that
   justifieth.--Whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he
   called, them he also justified.

   Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to

   The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto
   prayer.--Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
   roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.--Take heed to
   thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things
   which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the
   days of thy life.--The just shall live by faith: but if any man draw
   back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who
   draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the
   soul.

   What I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.

   Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I
   will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee

   Is his mercy clean gone for ever?--PSA. 77:8.

   His mercy endureth for ever.--The Lord is longsuffering, and of great
   mercy.--Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity? . . . he
   retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. He
   will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our
   iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sin into the depths of the
   sea.--Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according
   to his mercy he saved us.

   Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
   mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our
   tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any
   trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.

   Just Lot . . . that righteous man.

   Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that
   shall he also reap.--Remember Lot's wife.

   Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what
   fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion
   hath light with darkness? Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye
   separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing.--Be not ye .
   . . partakers with them. For ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye
   light in the Lord: walk as children of light: proving what is
   acceptable unto the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful
   works of darkness, but rather reprove them.

   If so be the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them

   He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may
   boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall
   do unto me.--I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make

   The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of
   righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.

   Stand . . . having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the
   breastplate of righteousness. For we wrestle not against flesh and
   blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers

   Thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.--Draw not
   nigh hither; put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon
   thou standest is holy ground . . . I am the God of thy father, the God
   of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his
   face; for he was afraid to look upon God.--To whom then will ye liken

   the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside
   me there is no saviour.

   conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.--Know
   ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you,
   which ye have of God, and ye are not your own.--Ye are the temple of

   Abraham believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for
   righteousness.--GEN. 15:6.

   He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong
   in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully persuaded that, what he
   had promised, he was able also to perform. And therefore it was imputed
   to him for righteousness. Now it was not written for his sake alone,
   that it was imputed to him: but for us also, to whom it shall be
   imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the
   dead.

   The promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to
   Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness
   of faith.

   The just shall live by faith.--Let us hold fast the profession of our
   faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised).--Our God is
   in the heavens; he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.--With God
   nothing shall be impossible. And blessed is she that believed: for
   there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from

   The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of
   his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.--Thou hast made us

   the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their
   Father.--Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure
   to give you the kingdom.

   I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; that
   ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones

   I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.--HEB. 13:5.

   what man shall do unto me.

   Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou
   goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave

   forsake thee.

   Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world. At my first

   the Lord will take me up.

   Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.--I am he that

   Though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: necessity is
   laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! I am
   made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.

   Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if
   we faint not.--My word . . . shall not return unto me void, but it

   Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his
   servants ye are to whom ye obey?

   All these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every
   man severally as he will. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to
   every man to profit withal.--As every man hath received the gift, even
   so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold
   grace of God.--It is required in stewards, that a man be found
   faithful. --Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much
   required: and to whom men have commited much, of him they will ask the
   more.

   Distributing to the necessity of saints.--ROM. 12:13.

   David said, Is there yet any that is left . . . of the house of Saul,
   that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?

   Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
   from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me
   meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye
   took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I
   was in prison, and ye came unto me. Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
   one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto
   me.--Whosoever shall give to drink one of these little ones a cup of
   cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he
   shall in no wise lose his reward.

   To do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God
   is well pleased.--God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour
   of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have

   MARCH 27 MORNING

   To him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.--PROV. 11:18.

   After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with
   them. And so he that had received five talents came and brought other
   five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents:
   behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. His lord said unto
   him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful
   over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou
   into the joy of thy lord.

   We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one
   may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath
   done, whether it be good or bad.

   I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the
   faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
   which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not
   to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.

   Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man
   take thy crown.

   Matt. 25:19-21.II Cor. 5:10.II Tim. 4:7,8.Rev. 3:11.

   MARCH 27 EVENING

   God is faithful.--I COR. 10:13.

   God is not a man that he should lie; neither the Son of man that he
   should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken,
   and shall he not make it good?--The Lord sware and will not repent.

   God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the
   immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two
   immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might
   have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
   the hope set before us.--Wherefore let them that suffer according to
   the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing,
   as unto a faithful Creator.

   I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep
   that which I have committed unto him against that day--Faithful is he
   that calleth you, who also will do it.--All the promises of God in him
   are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.

   Num. 23:19. -Heb. 7:21.Heb. 6:17,18. -I Pet. 4:19.II Tim. 1:12. -I

   MARCH 28 MORNING

   Be strong and of a good courage.--JOSH. 1:18.

   The Lord is my light and my salvation: whom shall I fear? the Lord is
   the strength of my life: of whom shall I be afraid?--He giveth power to
   the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even
   the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly
   fall: but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they
   shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary;
   and they shall walk, and not faint.--My flesh and my heart faileth: but
   God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.

   If God be for us, who can be against us?--The Lord is on my side; I
   will not fear: what can man do unto me?--Through thee will we push down
   our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up
   against us.--We are more than conquerors through him that loved us.

   Arise therefore, and be doing, and the Lord be with thee.

   MARCH 28 EVENING

   Our friend sleepeth.--JOHN 11:11.

   I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which
   are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For
   if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which
   sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

   If the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not
   raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also
   which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. But now is Christ risen
   from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.

   It came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan,
   that the Lord spake unto Joshua, saying, Take you hence out of the
   midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm,
   twelve stones . . . and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the
   children of Israel for ever.--This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we
   all are witnesses.--Witnesses chosen before of God, . . . who did eat
   and drink with him after he rose from the dead.

   MARCH 29 MORNING

   Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
   from the foundation of the world.--MATT. 25:34.

   Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give
   you the kingdom.--Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in
   faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that
   love him?--Heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we
   suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.

   The Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me.--God is not
   ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.

   He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
   he shall be my son.--There is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
   which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not
   to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.--He which
   hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus
   Christ.

   MARCH 29 EVENING

   Riches are not forever; and doth the crown endure to every
   generation?--PROV. 27:24.

   Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in
   vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.--Set
   your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.--Lay not up
   for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt,
   and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves
   treasures in heaven. For where your treasure is, there will your heart
   be also.

   They do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.--We
   look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not
   seen.--To him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.--There
   is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord, the
   righteous judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only but unto
   all them also that love his appearing.--A crown of glory that fadeth
   not away.

   MARCH 30 MORNING

   Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide.--GEN. 24:63.

   Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
   acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.

   When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the
   stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of
   him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?--The works of the Lord
   are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.

   Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
   standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the
   scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law
   doth he meditate day and night.--This book of the law shall not depart
   out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night.--My
   soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall
   praise thee with joyful lips: when I remember thee upon my bed, and
   meditate on thee in the night watches.

   MARCH 30 EVENING

   How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord! for ever? how long wilt thou hide
   thy face from me?--PSA. 13:1.

   Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down
   from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow
   of turning.--But Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
   forgotten me. Can a woman forget her suckling child, that she should
   not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet
   will I not forget thee.

   Thou shalt not be forgotten of me. I have blotted out, as a thick
   cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins.

   Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. When he had heard
   therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place
   where he was.--A woman . . . cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me,
   O Lord, thou son of David! But he answered her not a word.

   The trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that
   perisheth.

   MARCH 31 MORNING

   My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by
   Christ Jesus.--PHIL. 4:19.

   Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all ...
   things shall be added unto you.--He that spared not his Son, but
   delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him freely give us
   all things?

   All things are yours: whether Paul or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world,
   or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;
   and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.--As having nothing, and yet
   possessing all things.

   The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.--The Lord God is a sun and
   shield: the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will be
   withheld from them that walk uprightly.--The living God, ... giveth us
   richly all things to enjoy.--God is able to make all grace abound
   toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may
   abound to every good work.

   What communion hath light with darkness?--II COR. 6:14.

   Men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were
   evil.--Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day:
   we are not of the night, nor of darkness.

   Darkness hath blinded his eyes.--Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a
   light unto my path.

   The dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of
   cruelty.--Love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and
   knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.

   The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they
   stumble. The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth
   more and more unto the perfect day.

   I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should
   not abide in darkness

   Ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as
   children of light.

   The fruit of the Spirit is joy.--GAL. 5:22.

   Joy in the Holy Ghost.--Unspeakable and full of glory.

   Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; . . . exceeding joyful in all our
   tribulation.--We glory in tribulations.

   Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; . . . for the joy that was
   set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame.--These things
   have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your
   joy might be fuIl.--As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our
   consolation also aboundeth by Christ.

   Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.--The joy of the
   Lord is your strength.

   In thy presence is fulness of joy: at thy right hand there are
   pleasures for evermore.--For the Lamb which is in the midst of the
   throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of
   waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

   Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest, and I
   will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall
   be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his
   days.

   Behold, a greater than Solomon is here.--Unto us a child is born, unto
   us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and
   his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the
   everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.--My people shall dwell in a
   peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting
   places; when it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city
   shall be low in a low place.

   He is our peace.--This man shall be the peace when the Assyrian shall
   come into our land.

   These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them:

   If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the
   strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto

   Little children, keep yourselves from idols.--Come out from among them,
   and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing;
   and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be
   my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.--Ye cannot serve God
   and Mammon.

   Thou shalt worship no other god: for the Lord, whose name is Jealous,
   is a jealous God.--Serve him with a perfect heart with a willing mind:
   for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the
   imaginations of the thoughts.

   Behold, thou desireth truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part
   thou shalt make me to know wisdom.--Man looketh on the outward
   appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.--Beloved, if our heart
   condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.

   APRIL 2 EVENING

   When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?--LUKE 18:8.

   He came unto his own, and his own received him not.--The Spirit
   speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the
   faith.

   Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke,
   exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when
   they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall
   they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall
   turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables.

   Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are
   in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Take ye heed, watch and
   pray: for ye know not when the time is.--Blessed are those servants,
   whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching.--Looking for that
   blessed hope, ... the glorious appearing of the great God, and our
   Saviour Jesus Christ,

   APRIL 3 MORNING

   Beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the
   Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is
   not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness.--II PET. 3:8,9.

   My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith
   the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
   higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. For as the
   rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither,
   but watereth the earth, . . . so shall my word be that goeth forth out
   of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall acomplish
   that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent
   it.

   God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon
   all. O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
   how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!

   Isa. 55:8-11.Rom. 11:32,33.
     __________________________________________________________________

   APRIL 3 EVENING

   Ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning.--AMOS 4:11.

   The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
   hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among
   us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?--We had the sentence of death
   in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which
   raiseth the dead: who delivered us from so great a death, and doth
   deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us.--The wages of
   sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ
   our Lord.

   It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
   God.--Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.

   Be instant in season, out of season.--Others save with fear, pulling
   them out of the fire.

   Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of
   hosts.--Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the

   Fear not; I am the first and the last.--REV. 1:17.

   Ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned
   with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, but ye are
   come unto mount Sion, . . . to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits
   of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new
   covenant.--Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.--We have not a
   high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
   infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
   sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may
   obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

   Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of
   hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no
   God.--The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.

   Art thou not from everlasting, O Lord my God, mine Holy One?--Who is

   Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.--PSA. 61:2.

   Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication
   with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the
   peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts
   and minds through Christ Jesus.

   When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my
   path.--He knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall
   come forth as gold.--Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all
   generations.--Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the
   needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the
   heaven.

   Who is a rock save our God?--They shall never perish, neither shall any
   man pluck them out of my hand.--Uphold me according unto thy word, that
   I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.--Which hope we have
   as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth
   into that within the veil.

   I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.--GEN. 32:26.

   Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and

   O woman, great is thy faith; be it unto thee even as thou
   wilt.--According to your faith be it unto you.--Let him ask in faith,
   nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven
   with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall
   receive any thing of the Lord.

   They drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and [Jesus] made as
   though he would have gone further. But they constrained him, saying,
   Abide with us: . . . he vanished out of their sight. And they said one
   to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us
   by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?--I pray thee, if
   I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know
   thee, that I may find grace in thy sight.--My presence shall go with
   thee, and I will give thee rest.

   Sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ.--The very
   God of peace sanctify you wholly: and I pray God your whole spirit and
   soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.--He which
   hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus
   Christ.--Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made
   perfect by the flesh?--The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me.

   APRIL 6 MORNING

   He ever liveth to make intercession.--HEB. 7:25.

   Who is he that condemneth? it is Christ that died . . . who also maketh
   intercession for us.--Christ is not entered into the holy places made
   with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself,
   now to appear in the presence of God for us.

   If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
   righteous.--There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the
   man Christ Jesus.

   Seeing . . . that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the
   heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we
   have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
   infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
   sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may
   obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.--Through him we .
   . . have access by one Spirit unto the Father.

   They that know thy name will put their trust in thee.--PSA. 9:10.

   This is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR

   mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.

   His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor.--O Lord, I know that
   the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to
   direct his steps.

   The mighty God, The everlasting Father.--I know whom I have believed,
   and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
   unto him against that day.

   The Prince of Peace.--He is our peace.--Being justified by faith, we
   have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.

   The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it,
   and is safe.--Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help.--As birds
   flying, so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he
   will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it.

   APRIL 7 MORNING

   As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as
   having nothing, and yet possessing all things.--II COR. 6:10.

   We . . . rejoice in hope of the glory of God. And not only so, but we
   glory in tribulations also.--I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding
   joyful in all our tribulation.--Believing, ye rejoice with joy
   unspeakable and full of glory.

   In a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their
   deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.--Unto me,
   who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I
   should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; and
   to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from
   the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things
   by Jesus Christ.

   Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of
   the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?--God is able
   to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all
   sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.

   APRIL 7 EVENING

   The Lord strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all
   his bed in his sickness.--PSA. 41:3.

   In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence
   saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare
   them, and carried them.--He whom thou lovest is sick.--My grace is
   sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.

   Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the
   power of Christ may rest upon me.--I can do all things through Christ
   which strengtheneth me.

   We faint not; . . . though our outward man perish, yet the inward man
   is renewed day by day.

   In him we live, and move, and have our being.--He giveth power to the
   faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even the
   youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:
   but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.--The
   eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.

     __________________________________________________________________

   APRIL 8 MORNING

   In everything ye are enriched by him.--I COR. 1:5.

   When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the
   ungodly.--He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
   all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

   In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are
   complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power.

   Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,
   except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I
   am the vine ye are the branches: he that abideth in me and I in him,
   the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do
   nothing.--To will is present with me; but how to perform that which is
   good I find not.--Unto every one of us is given grace according to the
   measure of the gift of Christ.

   If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye
   will, and it shall be done unto you.--Let the word of Christ dwell in
   you richly in all wisdom.

   APRIL 8 EVENING

   They shall see his face.--REV. 22:4.

   I beseech thee shew me thy glory. And he said, Thou canst not see my
   face: for there shall no man see me, and live.--No man hath seen God at
   any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father,
   he hath declared him.

   Every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all
   kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.--I shall see him, but
   not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh.

   I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter
   day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body,
   yet in my flesh shall I see God.--I will behold thy face in
   righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy
   likeness.--We shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.--The
   Lord himself shall descend from heaven . . . the dead in Christ shall
   rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
   together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
   shall we ever be with the Lord.

   APRIL 9 MORNING

   Fear not; for I have redeemed thee.--ISA. 43:1.

   Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded;
   for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of
   thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any
   more. For thy Maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is his name;
   and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel.--I have blotted out, as a
   thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto
   me; for I have redeemed thee.--With the precious blood of Christ, as of
   a lamb without blemish and without spot.

   Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name: he shall
   throughly plead their cause.--My Father, which gave them me, is greater
   than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

   Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus
   Christ, who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from
   this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:
   to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

   APRIL 9 EVENING

   I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the Lord, and the praises of the
   Lord, according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us.--ISA. 63:7.

   He brought me up . . . out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay,
   and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.--The Son of God
   . . . loved me, and gave himself for me.--He that spared not his own
   Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also
   freely give us all things?--God commendeth his love toward us, in that,
   while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

   Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our
   hearts.--Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption
   of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

   God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
   even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ,
   (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together, and made us
   sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.

   Psa. 40:2. -Gal. 2:20. -Rom. 8:32. -Rom. 5:8.II Cor. 1:22. -Eph. 1:14.Eph. 2:4-6.
     __________________________________________________________________

   APRIL 10 MORNING

   I am black, but comely.--SONG 1:5.

   Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive
   me.--Thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was
   perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the
   Lord God.

   I am a sinful man, O Lord.--Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold,
   thou art fair.

   I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.--Thou art all fair, my
   love; there is no spot in thee.

   When I would do good, evil is present with me.--Be of good cheer; thy
   sins be forgiven thee.

   I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing--Ye are
   complete in him.--Perfect in Christ Jesus.

   Ye are washed, . . . ye are sanctified, . . . ye are justified in the
   name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.--That ye should
   shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into
   his marvellous light.

   APRIL 10 EVENING

   All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.--II TIM. 3:12.

   I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter
   against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
   And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.--Whosoever . . .
   will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.--Love not the world,
   neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world the
   love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the
   lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is
   not of the Father, but is of the world.

   If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If
   ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are
   not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the
   world hateth you. The servant is not greater than his lord.--I have
   given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are
   not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

   APRIL 11 MORNING

   In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth
   his lips is wise.--PROV. 10:19.

   My beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak,
   slow to wrath.--He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty: and
   he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.--If any man
   offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able to bridle the
   whole body.--By thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou
   shalt be condemned.--Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the
   door of my lips.

   Christ . . . suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should
   follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
   who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he
   threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth
   righteously.--Consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
   against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.

   In their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before
   the throne of God.

   Jas. 1:19. -Prov. 16:32. -Jas. 3:2. -Matt. 12:37. -Psa. 141:3.I Pet. 2:21-23. -Heb. 12:3.Rev. 14:5.

   APRIL 11 EVENING

   Teach me thy way, O Lord.--PSA. 27:11.

   I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I
   will guide thee with mine eye.--Good and upright is the Lord: therefore
   will he teach sinners in the way. The meek will he guide in judgment:
   and the meek will he teach his way.

   I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall
   go in and out, and find pasture.

   Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man
   cometh unto the Father, but by me.--Having . . . boldness to enter into
   the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he
   hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
   and having an high priest over the house of God; let us draw near with
   a true heart in full assurance of faith.

   Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.--All the paths of
   the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his
   testimonies.

   APRIL 12 MORNING

   What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God
   sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
   condemned sin in the flesh.--ROM. 8:3.

   The law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image
   of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year
   by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect. For then would
   they not have ceased to be offered?--By him all that believe are
   justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the
   law of Moses.

   Forasmuch . . . as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he
   also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he
   might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil; and
   deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject
   to bondage. For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he
   took on him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behoved him
   to be made like unto his brethren.

   Heb. 10:1,2. -Acts 13:39.Heb. 2:14-17.
     __________________________________________________________________

   APRIL 12 EVENING

   All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.--ROM. 3:23.

   There is none righteous, no, not one: there is none that doeth good,
   no, not one.--There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
   sinneth not.--How can he be clean that is born of a woman?

   Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into
   his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.

   I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Behold,
   I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.

   The Lord. . . hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.--Whom he
   justified, them he also glorified.--We all, with open face beholding as
   in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from
   glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.--If ye continue in
   the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of
   the gospel.

   Walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.

   APRIL 13 MORNING

   Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all
   thine increase.--PROV. 3:9.

   He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which
   soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.--Upon the first day of
   the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath
   prospered him.

   God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye
   have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints
   and do minister.

   I beseech you . . . brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present
   your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is
   your reasonable service.--The love of Christ constraineth us; because
   we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that
   he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto
   themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.--Whether
   therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of
   God.

   APRIL 13 EVENING

   There shall be no night there.--REV. 21:25.

   The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy
   glory.

   The city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it:
   for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light
   thereof.--They need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord
   God giveth them light.

   Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a
   peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath
   called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.--Giving thanks
   unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the
   inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered us from the
   power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear
   Son.--Ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk
   as children of light.

   We are not of the night, nor of darkness.

   The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and
   more unto the perfect day.

   My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth

   and meditate on thee in the night watches.--PSA. 63:5,6.

   How precious . . . are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the
   sum of them! If I should count them, they are more in number than the
   sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.--How sweet are thy words unto
   my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!--Thy love is better than
   wine.

   Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I
   desire beside thee.--Thou art fairer than the children of men.

   As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among
   the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit
   was sweet to my taste. He brought me to the banqueting house, and his
   banner over me was love.--His countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as
   the cedars. His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This
   is my beloved, and this is my friend.

   Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.--PSA. 51:12.

   I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and
   restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.

   Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins
   be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
   crimson, they shall be as wool.--Return, ye backsliding children, and I
   will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art
   the Lord our God.--I will hear what God the Lord will speak: for he
   will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not
   turn again to folly.

   Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: who
   forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases.--He
   restoreth my soul.--O Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry
   with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.

   Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe.

   Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob.--Mighty to save.--Able to keep you
   from falling.--Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.

   He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is
   condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only
   begotten Son of God.--He is able . . . to save them to the uttermost
   that come unto God by him.

   Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem?

   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? . . . I am persuaded,
   that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
   powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth,
   nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of

   Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not.--JER. 45:5.

   Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in
   heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.--Let this mind be in
   you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who, being in the form of God,
   thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no
   reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in
   the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled
   himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

   He that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of
   me.--Christ . . . suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye
   should follow his steps.

   Godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into
   this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food
   and raiment let us be therewith content.

   I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.

   I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless

   I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep
   waters, where the floods overflow me.--Waters flowed over mine head;
   then I said, I am cut off. I called upon thy name, O Lord, out of the
   low dungeon. Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my
   breathing, at my cry. Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon
   thee: thou saidst, Fear not.

   Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? Is
   his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? Hath
   God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender
   mercies? And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the
   years of the right hand of the most High. I will remember the works of
   the Lord: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.--I had fainted,
   unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of

   He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in

   And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest
   bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be
   with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not
   grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested.--Ask what I
   shall give thee. And Solomon said unto God, . . . Give me now wisdom
   and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people.--And
   God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness
   of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.

   Asa cried unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord, it is nothing with
   thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power . . .
   O Lord, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee. So the Lord

   Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me.--PSA. 50:23.

   Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and
   admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
   singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in
   word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to
   God and the Father by him.--Glorify God in your body, and in your
   spirit, which are God's.

   Ye are a royal priesthood . . . that ye should shew forth the praises
   of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous
   light.--Ye . . . as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, a
   holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by
   Jesus Christ.--By him . . . let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
   continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.

   My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear
   thereof, and be glad. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his
   name together.

   Col. 3:16,17. -I Cor. 6:20.I Pet. 2:9. -I Pet. 2:5. -Heb. 13:15.Psa. 34:2,3.

   APRIL 17 EVENING

   Draw me, we will run after thee.--SONG 1:4.

   I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with
   lovingkindness have I drawn thee.--I drew them with cords of a man,
   with bands of love.--I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all
   men unto me.--Behold the Lamb of God.--As Moses lifted up the serpent
   in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that
   whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.

   Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I
   desire beside thee.--We love him, because he first loved us.

   My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and
   come away. For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the
   flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come,
   and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; the fig tree putteth
   forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good
   smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.

   Jer. 31:3. -Hos. 11:4. -John 12:32. -John 1:36. -John 3:14,15.Psa. 73:25. -I John 4:19.Song 2:10-13.

   APRIL 18 MORNING

   I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto
   thee.--DEUT. 18:18.

   [Moses] stood between the Lord and you at that time, to shew you the
   word of the Lord: for ye were afraid.--There is one God, and one
   mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.

   Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the
   face of the earth.--Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am
   meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.--Let
   this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the
   form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made
   himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and
   was made in the likeness of men.

   Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a
   testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; but Christ as
   a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the
   confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.

   APRIL 18 EVENING

   Everlasting consolation.--II THES. 2:16.

   I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I
   will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.

   By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
   sanctified.--He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto
   God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.--I
   know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep
   that which I have committed unto him against that day.

   The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.--Who shall
   separate us from the love of Christ?--The Lamb which is in the midst of
   the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains
   of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.--So shall
   we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore cormfort one another with these
   words.

   This is not your rest.--Here have we no continuing city, but we seek
   one to come.

   APRIL 19 MORNING

   Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.--JOHN 10:7.

   The veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
   bottom.--Christ . . . hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
   unjust, that he might bring us to God.--The way into the holiest of all
   was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet
   standing.

   I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall
   go in and out, and find pasture.

   No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.--Through him we . . . have
   access by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye are no more
   strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of
   the household of God.--Having . . . boldness to enter into the holiest
   by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath
   consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.--We
   have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have
   access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope
   of the glory of God.

   Matt. 27:51. -I Pet. 3:18. -Heb. 9:8.John 10:9.John 14:6. -Eph. 2:18,19. -Heb. 10:19,20. -Rom. 5:1,2.

   APRIL 19 EVENING

   His word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I
   was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.--JER. 20:9.

   Necessity is laid upon me; yea woe is unto me, if I preach not the
   gospel! What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel,
   I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my
   power in the gospel.--They called them, and commanded them not to speak
   at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. But Peter and John answered and
   said unto them, . . . We cannot but speak the things which we have seen
   and heard.--The love of Christ constraineth us.

   I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth . . . Thou
   wicked and slothful servant, . . . thou oughtest . . . to have put my
   money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received
   mine own with usury.

   Go . . . to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath
   done for thee.

   I Cor. 9:16,18. -Acts 4:18-20. -II Cor. 5:14.Matt. 25:25-27.Mark 5:19.

   APRIL 20 MORNING

   There shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand.--DEUT. 13:17.

   Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch
   not the unclean thing.--Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and
   pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the
   soul.--Hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

   Beloved, now are we the sons of God . . . And it doth not yet appear
   what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be
   like him: for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this
   hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.--The grace of God
   that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that,
   denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
   righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed
   hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
   Christ: who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
   iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good
   works.

   Who art thou Lord? I am Jesus.--ACTS 26:15.

   It is I; be not afraid.--When thou passest through the waters, I will
   be with thee: and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee:
   when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither
   shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, . . . thy
   Saviour.

   Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
   evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort
   me.--Emmanuel, God with us.

   Thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their
   sins.--If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
   Christ the righteous.--Who is he that condemneth? it is Christ that
   died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of
   God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from
   the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
   famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

   APRIL 21 MORNING

   Stand fast in the Lord.--PHI. 4:1.

   My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.

   The Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are
   preserved for ever.--The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he
   shall preserve thy soul.

   The just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall
   have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back into
   perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.--If they
   had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they
   went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of
   us.

   If ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed.--He that
   shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.--Watch ye, stand
   fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.--Hold that fast which
   thou hast, that no man take thy crown.--He that overcometh, the same
   shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out
   of the book of life.

   APRIL 21 EVENING

   Enoch walked with God.--GEN. 5:22.

   Can two walk together, except they be agreed?

   Having made peace through the blood of his cross . . . You, that were
   sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now
   hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present
   you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight.--In Christ
   Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of
   Christ.

   If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his
   Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. And
   not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.

   The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
   communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.

   If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male
   without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will. And he
   shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be
   accepted for him to make atonement for him.--LEV. 1:3,4.

   God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.--Behold the Lamb
   of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.--We are sanctified
   through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.--A
   ransom for many.

   No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to
   lay it down, and I have power to take it again.--I will love them
   freely.--The Son of God . . . loved me and gave himself for me.

   He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be
   made the righteousness of God in him.--He hath made us accepted in the
   beloved.

   Great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the
   lowest hell.--PSA. 86:13.

   Fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

   Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name;
   thou art mine. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no
   saviour. I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine
   own sake, and will not remember thy sins,--They that trust in their
   wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; none of
   them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for
   him: for the redemption of their soul is precious.--I have found a
   ransom.--God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
   loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together
   with Christ.

   Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name
   under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

   APRIL 23 MORNING

   The Lord was my stay.--PSA. 18:18.

   Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the
   multitude of mountains: truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of
   Israel.--The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my
   God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my
   salvation, and my high tower.--Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of
   Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.

   The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and
   delivereth them. The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and
   delivereth them out of all their troubles.--The eternal God is thy
   refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.--So that we may boldly
   say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto
   me.--For who is God save the Lord? or who is a rock save our God? It is
   God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.

   By the grace of God I am what I am.

   APRIL 23 EVENING

   All we like sheep have gone astray.--ISA. 53:6.

   If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is
   not in us.--There is none righteous, no, not one: there is none that
   understandeth. They are all gone out of the way, they are together
   become unprofitable.

   Ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd
   and Bishop of your souls.--I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek
   thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.

   He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteous for his
   name's sake.

   My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give
   unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any
   man pluck them out of my hand.

   which is lost, until he find it?

   The Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as
   he had spoken.--GEN. 21:1.

   Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him:
   God is a refuge for us.--David encouraged himself in the Lord his
   God.--God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto
   the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.--I have
   seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I
   have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. He brought
   them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of
   Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.--There
   failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the
   house of Israel: all came to pass.

   He is faithful that promised.--Hath he said, and shall he not do it? or
   hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?--Heaven and earth shall
   pass away, but my words shall not pass away--The grass withereth, the
   flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.

   The eyes of all wait upon thee.--PSA. 145:15.

   He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things.--The Lord is good to
   all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.--Behold the fowls
   of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into
   barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.

   The same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

   I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
   help.--Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
   masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so
   our eyes wait upon the Lord our God.

   The Lord is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for
   him.--And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have
   waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited
   for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.--If we hope for
   that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.

   APRIL 25 MORNING

   Thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their
   sins--MATT. 1:21.

   Ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins.--That we, being
   dead to sins, should live unto righteousness.--He is able also to save
   them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.

   He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
   iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his
   stripes we are healed. The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us
   all.--Thus it behoved Christ to suffer, . . . that repentance and
   remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations.--He
   appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.

   Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour,
   . . . to give repentance.--Through this man is preached unto you the
   forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe are justified from all
   things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.--Your
   sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.

   APRIL 25 EVENING

   Our Lord Jesus Christ, . . . though he was rich, yet for your sakes . .
   . became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.--II COR. 8:9.

   It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.--The
   brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and
   upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself
   purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
   being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance
   obtained a more excellent name than they.--Who, being in the form of
   God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of
   no reputation.

   The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son
   of man hath not where to lay his head.

   All things are yours: whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the
   world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are
   yours; and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.

   APRIL 26 MORNING

   His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace

   Underneath are the everlasting arms.--When [Peter] saw the wind
   boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying,
   Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and
   caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst
   thou doubt?--The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he
   delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast
   down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.

   The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord
   shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his
   shoulders.--Casting all your care upon Him, for he careth for you.--He
   that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye.

   They shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my
   hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all.

   APRIL 26 EVENING

   Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear
   as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?--SONG 6:10.

   The church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.

   Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might
   sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he
   might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or
   wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without
   blemish.

   There appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the
   sun.--The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself
   ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen,
   clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of
   saints.--The righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ
   unto all and upon all them that believe.

   The glory which thou gavest me I have given them.

   APRIL 27 MORNING

   Brethren, the time is short.--I COR. 7:29.

   Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He
   cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a
   shadow, and continueth not.--The world passeth away, and the lust
   thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.--As in
   Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. Death is
   swallowed up in victory.--Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and
   whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or
   die, we are the Lord's.--To live is Christ, and to die is gain.

   Cast not away . . . your confidence, which hath great recompence of
   reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will
   of God, ye might receive the promise. For yet a little while, and he
   that shall come will come, and will not tarry.--The night is far spent,
   the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness,
   and let us put on the armour of light.--The end of all things is at

   APRIL 27 EVENING

   A new name.--REV. 2:17.

   The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.--Let every one
   that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.--They that are
   Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.--Ye
   are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in
   your spirit, which are God's.

   God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
   For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision, but a new creature.

   Be ye . . . followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love, as
   Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering
   and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. But fornication, and
   all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you,
   as becometh saints. Now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of
   light.

   Acts 11:26. -II Tim. 2:19. -Gal. 5:24. -I Cor. 6:20.Gal. 6:14,15.Eph. 5:1-3,8.

   APRIL 28 MORNING

   Behold the Lamb of God.--JOHN 1:29.

   It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take
   away sins. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice
   and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: in
   burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then
   said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to
   do thy will, O God.--He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he
   opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as
   a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.

   Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, . . .
   but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and
   without spot: . . . manifest in these last times for you who by him do
   believe in God . . . that your faith and hope might be in God.

   Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches and
   wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.

   Heb. 10:4-7. -Isa. 53:7.I Pet. 1:18-21.Rev. 5:12.
     __________________________________________________________________

   APRIL 28 EVENING

   I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.--PSA. 71:14.

   Not as though I had already attained, either were already
   perfect.--Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go
   on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from
   dead works, and of faith toward God.--The path of the just is as the
   shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.

   I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.
   Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon
   him as long as I live.--I will bless the Lord all times: his praise
   shall continually be in my mouth.

   Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion.--They rest not day and night,
   saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.--Whoso offereth praise
   glorifieth me.--Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In everything
   give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
   you.--Rejoice in the Lord, always; and again I say, Rejoice.

   APRIL 29 MORNING

   Consider how great things He hath done for you.--I SAM. 12:24.

   Thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these
   forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to
   know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his
   commandments, or no. Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as
   a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee.

   I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
   faithfulness hast afflicted me. It is good for me that I have been
   afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes. Before I was afflicted I
   went astray: but now have I kept thy word.--The Lord hath chastened me
   sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.--He hath not dealt with
   us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as
   the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them
   that fear him. He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

   Deut. 8:2,5.Psa. 119:75,71,67. -Psa. 118:18. -Psa. 103:10,11,14.
     __________________________________________________________________

   APRIL 29 EVENING

   That blessed hope, . . . the glorious appearing of the great God and
   our Saviour Jesus Christ.--TIT. 2:13.

   Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast,
   and which entereth into that within the veil: whither the forerunner is
   for us entered, even Jesus.--Whom the heaven must receive until the
   times of restitution of all things.--When he shall come to be glorified
   in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.

   The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
   And not only they, but ourselves also, . . . groan within ourselves,
   waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.--Beloved,
   now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall
   be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for
   we shall see him as he is.--When Christ, who is our life, shall appear,
   then shall ye also appear with him in glory.

   Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

   Heb. 6:19,20. -Acts 3:21. -II Thes. 1:10.Rom. 8:22,23. -I John 3:2.
   -Col. 3:4.Rev. 22:20.
     __________________________________________________________________

   APRIL 30 MORNING

   Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected.--I JOHN 2:5.

   The God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that
   great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting
   covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working
   in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ;
   to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

   Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.--If a
   man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we
   will come unto him, and make our abode with him.--Whosoever abideth in
   him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known
   him. Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth
   righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.--Herein is our
   love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment:
   because as he is, so are we in this world.

   Heb. 13:20,21.I John 2:3. -John 14:23. -I John 3:6,7. -I John 4:17.
     __________________________________________________________________

   APRIL 30 EVENING

   He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding.--PROV. 14:29.

   The Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God,
   merciful and gracious, longsuffering.--The Lord is not slack concerning
   his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to
   us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come
   to repentance.

   Be ye . . . followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love.--The
   fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
   goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no
   law.--This is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure
   grief, suffering wrongfully. If, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye
   take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. Christ . . . suffered
   for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who,
   when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened
   not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.

   Be ye angry, and sin not.

   Exo. 34:6. -II Pet. 3:9.Eph. 5:1. -Gal. 5:22,23. -I Pet. 2:19-21,23.Eph. 4:26.

   MAY 1 MORNING

   The fruit of the Spirit is peace.--GAL. 5:22.

   To be spiritually minded is life and peace.

   God hath called us to peace.--Peace I leave with you, my peace I give
   unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart
   be troubled, neither let it be afraid.--The God of hope fill you with
   all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the
   power of the Holy Ghost.

   I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep
   that which I have committed unto him against that day.--Thou wilt keep
   him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth
   in thee.

   The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of
   righteousness quietness and assurance for ever. And my people shall
   dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet
   resting places.--Whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall
   be quiet from fear of evil.

   Great peace have they which love thy law.

   Jehovah-shammah (The Lord is there.)--EZEK. 48:35.

   Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them,
   and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and
   be their God.

   I saw no temple: . . . for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the
   temple. The city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine
   in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light
   thereof.

   I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.--Whom have I in
   heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside
   thee.

   Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to
   generation. For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed:
   for the Lord dwelleth in Zion.--Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion;
   for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the
   Lord.--There shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the
   Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him.

   Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.--GEN. 28:16.

   Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the
   midst of them.--Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the
   world.--My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.

   Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy
   presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed
   in hell, behold, thou art there.--Am I a God at hand, saith the Lord,
   and not a God afar off? Can any hide himself in secret places that I
   shall not see him? saith the Lord, Do not I fill heaven and earth?
   saith the Lord.

   Behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee, how much
   less this house that I have builded?--Thus saith the high and lofty One
   that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and
   holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to
   revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the
   contrite ones.--Ye are the temple of living God.

   MAY 2 EVENING

   Keep yourselves from idols.--I JOHN 5:21.

   My son, give me thine heart.--Set your affection on things above, not
   on things on the earth.

   Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart and put
   the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be
   enquired of at all by them?--Mortify . . . your members which are upon
   the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil
   concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry.--They that will be
   rich fall into temptation and a snare. For the love of money is the
   root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from
   the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. But thou,
   O man of God, flee these things.

   If riches increase, set not your heart upon them.--My fruit is better
   than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.

   Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.--The Lord
   looketh on the heart.

   MAY 3 MORNING

   Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
   perfect.--MATT. 5:48.

   I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.--Ye shall
   be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you from
   other people, that ye should be mine.

   Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in
   your spirit, which are God's

   Ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and
   power.--Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
   iniquity.--Be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without
   spot, and blameless.

   Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the
   Lord.--Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
   therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this
   man shall be blessed in his deed.--Search me, O God, and know my heart:
   try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me,
   and lead me in the way everlasting.

   MAY 3 EVENING

   Perfecting holiness in the fear of God.--II COR. 7:1.

   Dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the
   flesh and spirit.

   Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part
   thou shalt make me to know wisdom.--Teaching us that denying
   ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
   godly, in this present world.--Let your light so shine before men, that
   they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in
   heaven.--Not as though I had already attained, either were already
   perfect.

   Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is
   pure.

   Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also
   hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.--For the perfecting of
   the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body
   of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
   knowledege of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of
   the stature of the fulness of Christ.

   Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither
   is his ear heavy, that it cannot hear.--ISA. 59:1.

   In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with
   strength in my soul.--While I was speaking in prayer, even the man
   Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused
   to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.

   Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou
   hast been my help, leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my
   salvation.--Be not thou far from me, O Lord, O my strength, haste thee
   to help me.

   Ah Lord God! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy
   great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for
   thee.--Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in
   whom we trust that he will yet deliver us.--Shall not God avenge his
   own elect, which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with
   them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily.

   I have glorified thee on the earth.--JOHN 17:4.

   My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his
   work.--I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the
   night cometh, when no man can work.

   Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? And they
   understood not the saying which he spake unto them.--This sickness is
   not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be
   glorified thereby. Said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldest believe,
   thou shouldest see the glory of God?

   Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and
   man.--Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.--All bare him
   witness, and wondered at the gracious words, which proceeded out of his
   mouth.

   Thou art worthy . . . for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God
   by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and peopIe, and nation;
   and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on
   the earth.

   Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink?
   or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? for your heavenly Father knoweth
   that ye have need of all these things.--MATT. 6:31,32.

   O fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear
   him. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the
   Lord shall not want any good thing.--No good thing will he withhold
   from them that walk uprightly. O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that
   trusteth in thee.

   I would have you without carefulness.--Be careful for nothing; but in
   everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
   requests be made known unto God.

   Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not
   fall on the ground without your Father. The very hairs of your head are
   all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many
   sparrows.--Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no
   faith?--Have faith in God.

   He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the
   night.--PSA. 105:39.

   Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that
   fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

   The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.--There
   shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and
   for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain,

   The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. The
   Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time
   forth, and even for evermore.--The Lord went before them by day in a
   pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of
   fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: he took not away the
   pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from
   before the people.

   MAY 6 MORNING

   Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed
   each other.--PSA. 85:10.

   A just God and a Saviour.

   The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify
   the law, and make it honourable.

   God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing
   their trespasses unto them.--Whom God hath set forth to be a
   propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness
   for the remission of sins that are past, through the forebearance of
   God; to declare I say at this time his righteousness: that he might be
   just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.--He was wounded
   for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the
   chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes, we are
   healed.--Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is
   God that justifieth.--To him that worketh not, but believeth on him
   that justifieth the ungodly; his faith is counted for righteousness.

   MAY 6 EVENING

   How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?--I COR. 15:35.

   Beloved, now are we the sons of God; . . . it doth not appear what we
   shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear we shall be like him;
   for we shall see him as he is.--As we have borne the image of the
   earthy, we shall also bear the image of heavenly.

   The Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; . . . shall change our vile body,
   that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the
   working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.

   Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be
   unto you. But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that
   they had seen a spirit.--He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
   after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once.

   If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you,
   he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal
   bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

   MAY 7 MORNING

   Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not
   troubled.--MATT. 24:6.

   God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
   Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the
   mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters
   thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the
   swelling thereof.--Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and
   shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment,
   until the indignation be overpast. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of
   his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their
   iniquity.--In the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until
   these calamities be overpast.--Your life is hid with Christ in God.

   He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting
   the Lord.

   These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In
   the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have
   overcome the world.

   MAY 7 EVENING

   They persecute him whom thou hast smitten.--PSA. 69:26.

   It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through
   whom they come!--Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and
   foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified
   and slain.--They did spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others
   smote him with the palms of their hands, saying, Prophesy unto us, thou
   Christ, Who is he that smote thee?--Likewise also the chief priests
   mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others;
   himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come
   down from the cross.--Of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom
   thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles,
   and the people of Israel, were gathered together, to do whatsoever thy
   hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.

   Surely he hath borne our grief, and carried our sorrows: yet we did
   esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

   MAY 8 MORNING

   It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief.--ISA. 53:10.

   Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from
   this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify
   thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both
   glorified it, and will glorify it again.--Father, if thou be willing,
   remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.
   And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.

   Being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became
   obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.--Therefore doth my
   Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it
   again.--For I came down from heaven, not to do mine will, but the will
   of him that sent me.--The cup which my father hath given me, shall I
   not drink it?

   The Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that
   please him.--My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,--Mine elect, in
   whom my soul delighteth.

   MAY 8 EVENING

   Ye that are the Lord's remembrancers, keep not silence.--ISA. 62:6.

   Thou . . . hast made us unto our God kings and priests.--The sons of
   Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to
   you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations. And if ye go
   to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye
   shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered
   before the Lord your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.

   I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain.--Their voice was
   heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto
   heaven.--The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are
   open unto their cry.--Pray one for another: the effectual fervent
   prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

   Come, Lord Jesus.--Make no tarrying, O my God.--Looking for and hasting
   unto the coming of the day of God.

   MAY 9 MORNING

   Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
   seen.--HEB. 11:1.

   If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
   miserable.

   Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart
   of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But
   God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.--After that ye believed
   ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest
   of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession.

   Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast
   believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
   believed.--Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see
   him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
   glory: receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your
   souls.

   We walk by faith, not by sight.--Cast not away therefore your
   confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.

   I Cor. 15:19.I Cor. 2:9,10. -Eph. 1:13,14. -John 20:29. -I Pet. 1:8,9.II Cor. 5:7. -Heb. 10:35.

   MAY 9 EVENING

   It is I; be not afraid.--JOHN 6:20.

   When I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand
   upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: I am he
   that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen;
   and have the keys of hell and of death.--I, even I, am he that blotteth
   out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy
   sins.

   Woe is me! for I am undone; . . . mine eyes have seen the King, the
   Lord of hosts. Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live
   coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
   and he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips;
   and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.--I have blotted
   out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins:
   return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.

   If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
   righteous.

   Rev. 1:17,18. -Isa. 43:25.Isa. 6:5-7. -Isa. 44:22.I John 2:1.

   MAY 10 MORNING

   For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy
   the works of the devil.--I JOHN 3:8.

   We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
   against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
   against spiritual wickedness in high places.--Forasmuch . . . as the
   children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise
   took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had
   the power of death. that is, the devil.--And having spoiled
   principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing
   over them.--I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
   salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of
   his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused
   them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood
   of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not
   their lives unto the death.

   Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   Eph. 6:12. -Heb. 2:14. -Col 2:15. -Rev. 12:10,11.I Cor. 15:57.

   MAY 10 EVENING

   Vanity of vanities; all is vanity.--ECCL. 1:2.

   We spend our years as a tale that is told. The days of our years are
   threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be
   fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is
   soon cut off, and we fly away.

   If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
   miserable.--Here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to
   come.--I am the Lord, I change not.--Our conversation (citizenship) is
   in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus
   Christ; who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like
   unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able
   even to subdue all things unto himself.--The creature was made subject
   to vanity, not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the
   same in hope.

   Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever.--Holy, holy,
   holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.

   Psa. 90:9,10.I Cor. 15:19. -Heb. 13:14. -Mal. 3:6. -Phi. 3:20,21. -Rom. 8:20.Heb. 13:8. -Rev. 4:8.

   MAY 11 MORNING

   Awake to righteousness, and sin not.--I COR. 15:34.

   Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day.
   Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be
   sober.

   It is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer
   than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let
   us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the
   armour of light.--Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that
   ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to
   stand.--Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have
   transgressed: and make you a new heart and a new spirit.--Lay apart all
   filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness
   the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.--Little children,
   abide in him that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and
   not be ashamed before him at his coming. If ye know that he is
   righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of
   him.

   My sheep hear my voice.--JOHN 10:27.

   Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: If any man hear my voice, and
   open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he
   with me.

   I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that
   knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my
   undefiled. I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn
   himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but
   I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

   Speak; for thy servant heareth.--When Jesus came to the place, he
   looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste and
   come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. And he made haste, and
   came down, and received him joyfully.--I will hear what God the Lord
   will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints:
   but let them not turn again to folly.

   MAY 12 MORNING

   Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and everyone that
   loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.--I JOHN 4:7.

   The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which
   is given unto us.--Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to
   fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
   Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that
   we are the children of God.--He that believeth on the Son of God hath
   the witness in himself.

   In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent
   his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through
   him.--In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
   sins, according to the riches of his grace.--That in the ages to come
   he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward
   us through Christ Jesus.

   Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.

   Rom. 5:5. -Rom. 8:15,16. -I John 5:10.I John 4:9. -Eph. 1:7. -Eph. 2:7.I John 4:11.

   MAY 12 EVENING

   Reproach hath broken my heart.--PSA. 69:20.

   Is not this the carpenter's son?--Can there any good thing come out of
   Nazareth?--Say we not well that thou are a Samaritan, and hast a
   devil?--He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.--We
   know that this man is a sinner.--He deceiveth the people.--This man
   blasphemeth.--Behold a man gluttonous and a winebibber, a friend of
   publicans and sinners.

   It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant
   as his lord.--This is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God
   endure grief, suffering wrongfully. For even hereunto were ye called:
   because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we
   should follow his steps. Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his
   mouth: who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he
   threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth
   righteously.--If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye.

   Matt. 13:55. -John 1:46. -John 8:48. -Matt. 9:34. -John 9:24. -John 7:12. -Matt. 9:3. -Matt. 11:19.Matt. 10:25. -I Pet. 2:19-23. -I Pet. 4:14.
     __________________________________________________________________

   MAY 13 MORNING

   Pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.--I TIM. 2:8.

   The true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth:
   for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they
   that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.--Then shalt
   thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say,
   Here I am.--When ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against
   any.

   Without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God
   must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
   diligently seek him.--Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he
   that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and
   tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of
   the Lord.

   If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.--My little
   children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any
   man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
   righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins.

   John 4:23,24. -Isa. 58:9. -Mark 11:25.Heb. 11:6. -Jas. 1:6,7.Psa. 66:18. -I John 2:1,2.

   MAY 13 EVENING

   My heart panteth, my strength faileth me.--PSA. 38:10.

   Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. From the end of the earth
   will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock
   that is higher than I.

   He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is
   made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in
   my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For when I
   am weak, then am I strong.

   When (Peter) saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to
   sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched
   forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little
   faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?--If thou faint in the day of
   adversity, thy strength is small.--He giveth power to the faint; and to
   them that have no might he increaseth strength.--The eternal God is thy
   refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.--Strengthened with all
   might, according to his glorious power.

   MAY 14 MORNING

   The fellowship of His sufferings.--PHI. 3:10.

   It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant
   as his lord.

   He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted
   with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised,
   and we esteemed him not.--In the world ye shall have
   tribulation.--Because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you
   out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.

   I looked for some to take pity, but there was none.--At my first answer
   no man stood with me, but all men forsook me.

   The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son
   of man hath not where to lay his head.--Here have we no continuing
   city, but we seek one to come.

   Let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto
   Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was
   set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down
   at the right hand of the throne of God.

   They overcame . . . by the blood of the Lamb.--REV. 12:11.

   Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that
   justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died.--It is
   the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.--I am the LORD. The
   blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and
   when I see the blood, I will pass over you.

   There is . . . no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.

   What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?
   These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed
   their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

   Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
   and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be
   glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

   God shall wipe away all tears: . . . there shall be no more death,
   neither sorrow, . . . for the former things are passed away.--REV. 21:4.

   He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away
   tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take
   away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.--Thy sun
   shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the
   Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning
   shall be ended.--The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people
   that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.--The voice of
   weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.--Sorrow
   and sighing shall flee away.

   I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from
   death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy
   destruction.--The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. Then
   shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed
   up in victory.

   Raised up together in Christ Jesus.--EPH. 2:6.

   Fear not; . . . I am he that liveth.--Father, I will that they also,
   whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am.

   We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.--He is the
   head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from
   the dead.--Ye are complete in him, which is the head.

   Forasmuch . . . as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he
   also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he
   might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil: and
   deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject
   to bondage.

   This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
   immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption,
   and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to
   pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

   MAY 16 MORNING

   A servant of Jesus Christ.--ROM. 1:1.

   Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.--If any man
   serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my
   servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.--Take my
   yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and
   ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden
   is light.

   What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.--Being
   made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto
   holiness, and the end everlasting life.

   Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what
   his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I
   have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.--Thou art no more a
   servant, but a son.

   Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free,
   and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. For, brethren, ye
   have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to
   the flesh.

   I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel.--PSA. 16:7.

   His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor.--Counsel is mine, and
   sound wisdom: I am understanding, I have strength.--Thy word is a lamp
   unto my feet, and a light unto my path.--Trust in the Lord with all
   thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways
   acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

   O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man
   that walketh to direct his steps.--Thine ears shall hear a word behind
   thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right
   hand, and when ye turn to the left.--Commit thy works unto the Lord,
   and thy thoughts shall be established.--He knoweth the way that I
   take.--Man's goings are of the Lord: how can a man then understand his
   own way?

   Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to
   glory.--This God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide
   even unto death.

   As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of
   conversation.--He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to
   walk, even as he walked. If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that

   nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the
   commandments of God.--Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet
   offend in one point, he is guilty of all.

   Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything, as of
   ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.--Teach me, O Lord, the way of
   thy statutes.

   Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God
   which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.--The
   God of peace, . . . make you perfect in every good work to do his will,
   working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus

   I have exalted one chosen out of the people.--PSA. 89:19.

   Verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the
   seed of Abraham. In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his
   brethren.--Upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the
   appearance of a man above upon it.--The Son of man . . . which is in
   heaven.--Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me,
   and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

   He made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
   servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in
   fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death,
   even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted
   him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name
   of Jesus every knee should bow.--Be watchful, and strengthen the things
   which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works
   perfect before God.

   resurrection, and the life.--Because I live, ye shall live also.--We
   are made partakers of Christ.--Partakers of the Holy Ghost.--Partakers
   of the divine nature.--The first man Adam was made a living soul; the
   last Adam was made a quickening spirit.--Behold, I shew you a mystery;
   We shall not all sleep, but we shall be changed, in a moment, in the
   twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound,
   and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

   Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to
   come.--Who liveth for ever and ever.--The blessed and only Potentate,
   the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality.--Unto
   the King eternal, immortal, . . . be honour and glory for ever and
   ever. Amen.

   MAY 18 EVENING

   Let us not be desirous of vain glory.--GAL. 5:26.

   Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would
   give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden
   earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) And they answered, We will
   willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein
   every man the earrings of his prey. And Gideon made an ephod thereof,
   and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a
   whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his
   house.

   Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not.--Lest I should be
   exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there
   was given to me a thorn in the flesh.

   Let nothing be done, through strife or vain glory; but in lowliness of
   mind let each esteem other better than themselves.--Charity envieth
   not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not pufied up, doth not behave
   itself unseemly, seeketh not her own.

   Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me.

   Judg. 8:24,25,27.Jer. 45:5. -II Cor. 12:7.Phi. 2:3. -I Cor. 13:4,5.Matt. 11:29.

   MAY 19 MORNING

   Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity.--PSA. 51:2.

   I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned
   against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have
   sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.--Then will I
   sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your
   filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.

   Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into
   the kingdom of God.--If the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes
   of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the
   flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
   Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from
   dead works to serve the living God?

   He saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power
   to be known.--Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give
   glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.

   Jer. 33:8. -Ezek. 36:25.John 3:5. -Heb. 9:13,14.Psa. 106:8. -Psa. 115:1.

   MAY 19 EVENING

   Fellowship in the gospel.--PHI. 1:5.

   As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that
   one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. For by one
   Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or
   Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink
   into one Spirit.

   God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son
   Jesus Christ our Lord.--That which we have seen and heard declare we
   unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our
   fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.

   If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one
   with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from
   all sin.--These words spake Jesus. Neither pray I for these alone, but
   for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they
   all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they
   also may be one in us.

   MAY 20 MORNING

   Take heed unto thyself.--I TIM. 4:16.

   Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now
   they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I
   therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that
   beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection
   lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should
   be a castaway.--Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to
   stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against the
   flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against
   the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness
   in high places.

   They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and
   lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the spirit.--For
   as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
   God.--Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy
   profiting may appear to all.

   I Cor. 9:25-27. -Eph. 6:11,12.Gal. 5:24,25. -Rom. 8:14. -I Tim. 4:15.

   Jesus saith unto her, Mary.--JOHN 20:16.

   Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by name: Thou
   art mine.--The sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by
   name. And the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.

   Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are
   continually before me.

   The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth
   them that are his.--We have a great high priest, that is passed into
   the heavens, Jesus the Son of God.

   Thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the
   children of Israel. And Aaron shall bear their names before the Lord
   upon his two shoulders for a memorial. And thou shalt make the
   breastplate of judgment. And thou shalt set in it four rows of stones.
   And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, . . .
   and they shall be upon Aaron's heart when he goeth in before the Lord.

   MAY 21 MORNING

   My brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
   might.--EPH. 6:10.

   My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in
   weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities,
   that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in
   infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in
   distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.--I
   will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy
   righteousness, even of thine only.--The gospel of Christ . . . is the
   power of God unto salvation.

   I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.--I also
   labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me
   mightily.--We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the
   excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.

   The joy of the Lord is your strength.--Strengthened with all might,
   according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering
   with joyfulness.

   MAY 21 EVENING

   Jesus Christ our Lord.--I COR. 1:9.

   Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins.--He humbled
   himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
   Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which
   is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
   of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.

   Messias . . . which is called Christ.--The Lord hath anointed me to
   preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the
   brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives.

   The last Adam was made a quickening spirit. The second man is the Lord
   from heaven.--My Lord and my God.--Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye
   say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master have washed your
   feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an
   example, that ye should do as I have done to you.

   MAY 22 MORNING

   Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world
   giveth, give I unto you.--JOHN 14:27.

   The world passeth away, and the lust thereof.--Surely every man walketh
   in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up
   riches. and knoweth not who shall gather them.--What fruit had ye then
   in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things
   is death.

   Martha, Martha, thou are careful and troubled about many things: but
   one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall
   not be taken away from her.--I would have you without carefulness.

   These things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace. In
   the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer: I have
   overcome the world.--The Lord of peace himself give you peace always by
   all means.--The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face
   shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his
   countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.

   The Spirit helpeth our infirmities.--ROM. 8:26.

   The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost.--What? know ye not that your
   body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of
   God?--It is God which worketh in you.

   We know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself
   maketh intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered. And
   he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit,
   because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of
   God.

   He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.--A bruised reed
   shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench.

   The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

   The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in
   green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.

   John 14:26. -I Cor. 6:19. -Phi. 2:13.Rom. 8:26,27.Psa. 103:14. -Isa. 42:3.Matt. 26:41.Psa. 23:1,2.

   MAY 23 MORNING

   Thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod for
   stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and Aaron shall bear
   their names before the Lord.--EXO. 28:12.

   Jesus . . . because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable
   priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost
   that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession
   for them.--Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present
   you faultless before the presence of his glory.

   Seeing . . . that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the
   heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we
   have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
   infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without
   sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace.

   The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him: and the Lord
   shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his
   shoulders.

   On that night could not the king sleep.--ESTH. 6:1.

   Thou holdest mine eyes waking.--Who is like unto the Lord our God, . .
   . who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in
   the earth!

   He doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the
   inhabitants of the earth.--Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the
   great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.--Surely the wrath of man
   shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.

   The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew
   himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward
   him.--We know that all things work together for good to them that love
   God.

   Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not

   MAY 24 MORNING

   Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day
   of redemption.--EPH. 4:30.

   The love of the Spirit.--The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost.--In
   all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence
   saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare
   them, and carried them all the days of old. But they rebelled, and
   vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he turned to be their enemy, and he
   fought against them.

   Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath
   given us of his Spirit.--After that ye believed, ye were sealed with
   that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of the inheritance
   until the redemption of the purchased possession.--This I say then,
   Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh. For
   the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh:
   and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the
   things that ye would.

   The Spirit helpeth our infirmities.

   MAY 24 EVENING

   I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence,
   and seek my face.--HOS. 5:15.

   Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, your sins have
   hid his face from you.--My beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone:
   . . . I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave
   me no answer.--I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on forwardly in the
   way of his heart. I have seen his ways, and will heal him.--Hast thou
   not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy
   God when he led thee by the way?

   He arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off,
   his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck,
   and kissed him.--I will heal their backsliding, I will love them
   freely: for mine anger is turned away.

   If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
   and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

   MAY 25 MORNING

   How great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear
   thee!--PSA. 31:19.

   Since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by
   the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath
   prepared for him that waiteth for him.--Eye hath not seen, nor ear
   heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God
   hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto
   us by his Spirit.--Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence
   is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.

   How excellent is thy loving kindness, O God! therefore the children of
   men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. They shall be
   abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make
   them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain
   of life: in thy light shall we see light.

   Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life
   that now is, and of that which is to come.

   MAY 25 EVENING

   The Son of God, . . . hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire.--REV. 2:18.

   The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who
   can know it? I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give
   every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his
   doings.--Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in
   the light of thy countenance.--The Lord turned, and looked upon Peter.
   And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.

   Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, and
   needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in
   man.--He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.--A bruised
   reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench.

   The Lord knoweth them that are his.--I am the good shepherd, and know
   my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
   and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither
   shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

   known of mine. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow
   me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,
   neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

   The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in
   green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my
   soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

   All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own
   way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.--I am the
   good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.--I will
   seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away,
   and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which
   was sick.--Ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the
   Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

   The city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it:
   for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light
   thereof.--REV. 21:23.

   I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun,
   shining round about me. And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I
   am Jesus whom thou persecutest.--Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John
   his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, and was
   transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his
   raiment was white as the light.--The sun shall be no more thy light by
   day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but
   the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy
   glory. Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw
   itself: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of
   thy mourning shall be ended.

   Praise the Lord of hosts: for the Lord is good; for his mercy endureth
   for ever.--God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
   trouble.--I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my
   God; in him will I trust.--Who is like unto thee, O people saved by the
   Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy
   excellency!--As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is
   tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him. For who is God,
   save the Lord? and who is a rock, save our God?

   If any man love God, the same is known of him.--The foundation of God
   standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.
   And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from

   O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth

   the Lord shall not want any good thing.--Therefore I say unto you, Take
   no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink;
   nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than
   meat, and the body than raiment? Behold the fowls of the air: for they
   sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly
   Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?--Be careful for
   nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with
   thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of
   God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds
   through Christ Jesus.

   MAY 28 MORNING

   We look for the Saviour.--PHI. 3:20.

   The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to men, teaching
   us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, should live soberly,
   righteously, and godly, in this present world, looking for that blessed
   hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
   Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
   iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good
   works.--We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new
   earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that
   ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in
   peace, without spot, and blameless.

   Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that
   look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto
   salvation.--And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we
   have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have
   waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

   So run, that ye may obtain.--I COR. 9:24.

   The slothful man saith, There is a lion without.--Let us lay aside
   every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run
   with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the
   author and finisher of our faith.

   Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
   perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

   I press toward the mark.--I . . . so run, not as uncertainly; I keep
   under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, .
   . . I myself should be a castaway.

   The fashion of this world passeth away.

   Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a
   new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing
   that ye look for such things, be diligent.--Gird up the loins of your
   mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought
   unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

   MAY 29 MORNING

   The life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon
   the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that
   maketh an atonement for the soul.--LEV. 17:11.

   Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.--The
   blood of the Lamb.--The precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
   blemish and without spot.--Without shedding of blood is no
   remission.--The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all
   sin.

   By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having
   obtained eternal redemption for us.--Having therefore, brethren,
   boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and
   living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is
   to say, his flesh; let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance
   of faith.

   Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in
   your spirit, which are God's.

   John 1:29. -Rev. 7:14. -I Pet. 1:19. -Heb. 9:22. -I John 1:7.Heb. 9:12.

   MAY 29 EVENING

   Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at
   rest.--PSA. 55:6.

   It came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement
   east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted,
   and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than
   to live.

   Job spake, and said, Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,
   and life unto the bitter in soul; which long for death, but it cometh
   not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures?--Many are the
   afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them
   all.

   Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from
   this hour.--In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his
   brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in
   things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the
   people. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able
   to succour them that are tempted.

   Jon. 4:8.Job 3:2,20,21. -Psa. 34:19.John 12:27. -Heb. 2:17,18.
     __________________________________________________________________

   MAY 30 MORNING

   Let us labour to enter into that rest.--HEB. 4:11.

   Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the
   way, that leadeth to destruction: . . . strait is the gate, and narrow
   is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find
   it.--The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it
   by force.--Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat
   which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give
   unto you.--Give diligence to make your calling and election sure: . . .
   for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the
   everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.--So run, that
   ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate
   in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an
   incorruptible.

   For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own
   works, as God did from his.--The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting
   light, and thy God thy glory.

   Matt. 7:13,14. -Matt. 11:12. -John 6:27. -II Pet. 1:10,11. -I Cor. 9:24,25.Heb. 4:10. -Isa. 60:19.

   MAY 30 EVENING

   Thou hearest me always.--JOHN 11:42.

   Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast
   heard me.--Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from
   heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it
   again.--Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.--Not my will, but thine, be
   done.

   As he is, so are we in this world.--This is the confidence that we have
   in him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us.

   Whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments,
   and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.

   Without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God
   must believe that He is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
   diligently seek him.

   He ever liveth to make intercession for them.--We have an advocate with
   the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.

   MAY 31 MORNING

   Thy name shall be called Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with
   God and with men, and hast prevailed.--GEN. 32:28.

   By his strength he had power with God: yea, he had power over the
   angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him.--Abraham
   staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in
   faith, giving glory to God.

   Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say
   unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and
   shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which
   he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.
   Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray,
   believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.--If thou canst
   believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.--Blessed is she
   that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which
   were told her from the Lord.

   Lord, increase our faith.

   Hos. 12:3,4. -Rom. 4:20.Mark 11:22-24. -Mark 9:23. -Luke 1:45. -Luke 17:5.

   MAY 31 EVENING

   Little children, abide in him.--I JOHN 2:28.

   He that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and
   tossed. Let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the
   Lord. A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.

   I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the
   grace of Christ unto another gospel: which is not another. Though we,
   or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that
   which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.

   Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified
   by the law; ye are fallen from grace. Ye did run well; who did hinder
   you?

   As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine;
   no more can ye, except ye abide in me. If ye abide in me, and my words
   abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto
   you.--For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him, Amen,
   unto the glory of God by us.

   JUNE 1 MORNING

   The fruit of the Spirit is longsuffering, gentleness.--GAL. 5:22.

   The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and
   abundant in goodness and truth.

   Walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness
   and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love.--Be
   ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as
   God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.--The wisdom that is from above
   is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full
   of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without
   hypocrisy.--Charity suffereth long, and is kind.

   In due season we shall reap, if we faint not.--Be patient therefore,
   brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth
   for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it,
   until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient;
   stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

   JUNE 1 EVENING

   Emmanuel, . . . God with us.--MATT. 1:23.

   Will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and
   the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee.--The Word was made flesh,
   and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
   begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.--Great is the mystery
   of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh.

   God hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath
   appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.

   The first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples
   were assembled, . . . came Jesus and stood in the midst. Then were the
   disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. After eight days again his
   disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Then saith [Jesus] to
   Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither
   thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but
   believing. Thomas . . . said, My Lord and my God.--Unto us a Son is
   given: the mighty God.

   II Chr. 6:18. -John 1:14. -I Tim. 3:16.Heb 1:2.John 20:19,20,26-28.

   JUNE 2 MORNING

   Thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, and ye shall eat it in
   haste: it is the Lord's passover.--EXO. 12:11.

   Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest.--Here have we no
   continuing city, but we seek one to come.--There remaineth therefore a
   rest for the people of God.

   Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye
   yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return
   from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto
   him immediately. Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he
   cometh shall find watching.--Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober,
   and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the
   revelation of Jesus Christ.--This one thing I do, forgetting those
   things which are behind, . . . I press toward the mark for the prize of
   the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as
   be perfect, be thus minded.

   JUNE 2 EVENING

   The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup.--PSA. 16:5.

   Heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.--All things are yours.--My
   beloved is mine.--The Son of God . . . loved me, and gave himself for
   me.

   The Lord spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their
   land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and
   thy inheritance among the children of Israel.

   Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I
   desire beside thee. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the
   strength of my heart, and my portion forever.

   Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
   evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.--I
   know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep
   that which I have committed unto him against that day.

   O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for
   thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land.

   JUNE 3 MORNING

   Watch, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man
   cometh.--MATT. 25:13.

   Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged
   with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that
   day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them
   that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray
   always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that
   shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.

   The day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they
   shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them,
   as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. But ye,
   brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a
   thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day;
   we are not of the night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep,
   as do others; but let us watch and be sober.

   Luke 21:34-36.I Thes. 5:2-6.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JUNE 3 EVENING

   I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.--GEN. 17:1.

   Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect. I
   count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do,
   forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those
   things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the
   high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

   Enoch walked with God and he was not; for God took him.

   Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ.--We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of
   the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as
   by the Spirit of the Lord.

   These words spake Jesus, I pray not that thou shouldest take them out
   of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. I in
   them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.

   Phi. 3:12-14.Gen. 5:24.II Pet. 3:18. -II Cor. 3:18.John 17:1,15,23.

   JUNE 4 MORNING

   The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, and
   in this place will I give peace.--HAG. 2:9.

   The house that is to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding
   magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries.--The glory
   of the Lord. . . filled the Lord's house.

   Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. He spake of
   the temple of his body.--That which was made glorious had no glory in
   this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth.--The Word was made
   flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of
   the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth.--God . . .
   hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath
   appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.

   Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward
   men.--The Prince of Peace.--He is our peace.--The peace of God, which
   passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through
   Christ Jesus.

     __________________________________________________________________

   JUNE 4 EVENING

   Let us put on the armour of light.--ROM. 13:12.

   Put . . . on the lord Jesus Christ.--That I may win Christ, and be
   found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law,
   but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which
   is of God by faith.--The righteousness of God which is by faith of
   Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe.

   He hath covered me with the robe of righteousness.--I will go in the
   strength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy righteousness,
   even of thine only.

   Ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as
   children Light. Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of
   darkness but rather reprove them. All things that are reproved are made
   manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
   Awake thou that sleepest, and rise from the dead, and Christ shall give
   thee light. See then that ye walk circumspectly.

   Rom. 13:14. -Phi. 3:8,9. -Rom. 3:22.Isa. 61:10. -Psa. 71:16.Eph. 5:8,11,13-15.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JUNE 5 MORNING

   When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say,
   We are unprofitable servants.--LUKE 17:10.

   Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but
   by the law of faith.--What hast thou that thou didst not receive? now
   if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not
   received it?--By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
   yourselves; it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should
   boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
   works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

   By the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed
   upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all:
   yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.--For of him, and
   through Him, and to Him, are all things.--All things come of thee and
   of thine own have we given thee.

   Enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man
   living be justified.

   Rom. 3:27. -I Cor. 4:7. -Eph. 2:8-10.I Cor. 15:10. -Rom. 11:36. -I Chr. 29:14.Psa. 143:2.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JUNE 5 EVENING

   He knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.--PSA. 103:14.

   The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into
   his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

   I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous
   are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. My substance was
   not hid from thee, when I was made in secret. Thine eyes did see my
   substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were
   written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was
   none of them.

   Have we not all one father? Hath not one God created us?--In him we
   live, and move, and have our being.--Like as a father pitieth his
   children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.

   He, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed
   them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir
   up all his wrath. For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind
   that passeth away, and cometh not again.

   JUNE 6 MORNING

   He will rest in his love.--ZEPH. 3:17.

   The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were
   more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:
   but because the Lord loved you.--We love him, because he first loved
   us.--You . . . hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through
   death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his
   sight.

   Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent
   his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.--God commendeth his love
   toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

   Lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
   well pleased.--Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my
   life, that I might take it again.--His son . . . who being the
   brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and
   upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself
   purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.

   JUNE 6 EVENING

   A new and living way.--HEB. 10:20.

   Cain went out from the presence of the Lord.--Your iniquities have
   separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face
   from you.--Without holiness, no man shall see the Lord.

   I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the
   Father, but by me.--Our Saviour Jesus Christ . . . hath abolished
   death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the
   gospel.

   The way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the
   first tabernacle was yet standing.--He is our peace, who hath made both
   one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us.--The
   veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.

   Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and
   few there be that find it.--Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy
   presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for
   evermore.

   JUNE 7 MORNING

   Men ought always to pray, and not to faint.--LUKE 18:1.

   Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight,
   and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine in
   his journey is come to me and I have nothing to set before him? And he
   from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut,
   and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. I say
   unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his
   friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as
   many as he needeth.--Praying always with all prayer and supplication in
   the Spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and
   supplication for all saints.

   I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.--As a prince hast thou
   power with God and with men.--Continue in prayer, and watch in the same
   with thanksgiving.

   [Jesus] went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in
   prayer to God.

   JUNE 7 EVENING

   Forgive all my sins.--PSA. 25:18.

   Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins
   be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
   crimson, they shall be as wool.

   Be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.--I, even I, am he that
   blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not
   remember thy sins.

   The Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins.--In Whom we have
   redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the
   riches of his grace.--Not by works of righteousness which we have done,
   but according to His mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration,
   and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through
   Jesus Christ our Saviour.--Having forgiven you all trespasses, blotting
   out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was
   contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.

   Bless the Lord, O my soul, . . . who forgives all thine iniquities.

   The Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.--GEN. 39:3.

   Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord; that walketh in his ways.
   For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and
   it shall be well with thee.--Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt
   thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Delight thyself
   also in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of thine
   heart.--Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God
   is with thee whithersoever thou goest.

   Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these
   things shall he added unto you.

   As long as he sought the Lord, God made him to prosper.--Beware that
   thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and
   his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day: and
   thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath
   gotten me this wealth.

   Is not the Lord your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on

   Why reason ye these things in your hearts?--MARK 2:8.

   Being not weak in faith, [Abraham] considered not his own body now
   dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness
   of Sarah's womb; he staggered not at the promise of God through
   unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.

   Is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee
   or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?--If thou canst
   believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.

   All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.--Why are ye so
   fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?--Behold the fowls of the air;
   . . . your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than
   they?--Why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no
   bread? Do ye not . . . remember the five loaves of the five thousand?

   My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by
   Christ Jesus.

   JUNE 9 MORNING

   Never man spake like this man.--JOHN 7:46.

   Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy
   lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.--The Lord GOD hath
   given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a
   word in season to him that is weary.--His mouth is most sweet: yea, he
   is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend.

   All bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which
   proceeded out of his mouth.--He taught them as one having authority,
   and not as the scribes.

   Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.--The sword of
   the Spirit . . . is the word of God.--The word of God is quick, and
   powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword.--The weapons of our
   warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of
   strongholds; casting down imaginations, and every high thing that
   exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into
   captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.

   Psa. 45:2. -Isa. 50:4. -Song 5:16.Luke 4:22. -Matt. 7:29.Col. 3:16.

   JUNE 9 EVENING

   The triumphing of the wicked is short.--JOB 20:5.

   Thou shalt bruise his heel.--This is your hour, and the power of
   darkness.--As the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also
   himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might
   destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.--Having
   spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly,
   triumphing over them in it.

   Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring
   lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour: whom resist stedfast in
   the faith.--Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

   The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his
   teeth. The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is
   coming.--The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
   shortly.--The devil . . . was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone
   . . . and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

   Gen. 3:15. -Luke 22:53. -Heb. 2:14. -Col. 2:15.I Pet. 5:8,9. -Jas. 4:7.Psa. 37:12,13. -Rom. 16:20. -Rev. 20:10.

   JUNE 10 MORNING

   The younger son took his journey into a far country, and there wasted
   his substance with riotous living.--LUKE 15:13.

   Such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye
   are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our
   God.--We . . . were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
   But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved
   us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with
   Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together, and
   made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.

   Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent
   his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

   God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
   Christ died for us. If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God
   by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved
   by his life.

   I Cor. 6:11. -Eph. 2:3-6.I John 4:10.Rom. 5:8,10.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JUNE 10 EVENING

   As Christ forgave you, so also do ye.--COL. 3:13.

   There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five
   hundred pence, and the other fifty. And when they had nothing to pay,
   he frankly forgave them both.--I forgave thee all that debt; shouldest
   not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had
   pity on thee?

   When ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your
   Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if
   ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive
   your trespasses.--Put on as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels
   of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
   forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a
   quarrel against any.

   How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven
   times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times:
   but, until seventy times seven.

   Charity . . . is the bond of perfectness.

   Luke 7:41,42. -Matt.18:32,33.Mark 11:25,26. -Col. 3:12,13.Matt. 18:21,22.Col. 3:14.

   JUNE 11 MORNING

   He arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off,
   his father saw him, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed
   him.--LUKE 15:20.

   The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in
   mercy. He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for
   ever. He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
   according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth,
   so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. As far as the east is
   from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. Like
   as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear
   him.

   Ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
   The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the
   children of God.--Ye who sometime were far off are made nigh by the
   blood of Christ.--Now therefore ye are no more strangers and
   foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household
   of God.

   Psa. 103:8-13.Rom. 8:15,16. -Eph. 2:13. -Eph. 2:19.

   JUNE 11 EVENING

   Behold, I make all things new.--REV. 21:5.

   Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.--If any
   man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away;
   behold, all things are become new.

   A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within
   you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will
   give you an heart of flesh.--Purge out therefore the old leaven, that
   ye may be a new lump.--The new man, which after God is created in
   righteousness and true holiness.

   Thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall
   name.

   Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not
   be remembered, nor come into mind.--Seeing . . . that all these things
   shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy
   conversation and godliness?

   John 3:3. -II Cor. 5:17.Ezek. 36:26. -I Cor. 5:7. -Eph. 4:24.Isa. 62:2.Isa. 65:17. -II Pet. 3:11.

   JUNE 12 MORNING

   Everything that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the
   fire, and it shalI be clean.--NUM. 31:23.

   The Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your
   God with all your heart, and with all your soul.--He shall sit as a
   refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi,
   and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an
   offering in righteousness.--Every man's work shall be made manifest:
   for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and
   the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.

   I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and
   take away all thy tin.--I will melt them. and try them.

   Thou, O God, hast proved us; thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. We
   went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a
   wealthy place.

   When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither
   shall the flame kindle upon thee.

   Deut. 13:3. -Mal. 3:3. -I Cor. 3:13.Isa. 1:25. -Jer. 9:7.Psa. 66:10,12.Isa. 43:2.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JUNE 12 EVENING

   We, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness.--I PET. 2:24.

   Put off, concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is
   corrupt according to the deceitful lusts: and be renewed in the spirit
   of your mind; and . . . put on the new man, which after God is created
   in righteousness and true holiness.

   Ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God.--As Christ was
   raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also
   should walk in newness of life. Knowing this, that our old man is
   crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that
   henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from
   sin. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but
   alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore
   reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof:
   but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead,
   and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.

   Eph. 4:22-24.Col. 3:3. -Rom. 6:4,6,7,11-13.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JUNE 13 MORNING

   Abide in me, and I in you.--JOHN 15:4.

   I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ
   liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the
   faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.

   I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for
   to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I
   find not. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body
   of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.--If Christ be
   in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because
   of righteousness.--If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled,
   and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard.

   Little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have
   confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.--He that saith
   he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.

   JUNE 13 EVENING

   Dost thou believe on the Son of God?--JOHN 9:35.

   Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?

   The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person.--The
   blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who
   only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach
   unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power
   everlasting. Amen.--I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending,
   saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the
   Almighty.

   Lord, I believe.--I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he
   is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.

   Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he
   that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore which
   believe he is precious.

   John 9:36.Heb. 1:3. -I Tim. 6:15,16. -Rev. 1:8.John 9:38. -II Tim. 1:12.I Pet. 2:6,7.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JUNE 14 MORNING

   As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also
   aboundeth by Christ.--II COR. 1:5.

   The fellowship of his sufferings.--Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are
   partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be
   revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.--For if we be dead
   with him, we shall also live with him.--If children, then heirs; heirs
   of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him,
   that we may be also glorified together.

   God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the
   immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two
   immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might
   have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
   the hope set before us.--Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God, even
   our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting
   consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and
   stablish you in every good word and work.

   JUNE 14 EVENING

   Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things.--LUKE 10:41.

   Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap. Consider the lilies
   how they grow: they toil not, they spin not. Seek not ye what ye shall
   eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. Your
   Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.

   Having food and raiment let us be therewith content . . . They that
   will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish
   and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For
   the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted
   after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through
   with many sorrows.

   The cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lust
   of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh
   unfruitful.

   Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset
   us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.

   Luke 12:24,27,29,30.I Tim. 6:8-10.Mark 4:19.Heb. 12:1.

   JUNE 15 MORNING

   The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those which are
   revealed belong unto us.--DEUT. 29:29.

   Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I
   exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. Surely
   I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his
   mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.

   The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him: and he will shew
   them his covenant.--There is a God in heaven that revealeth
   secrets.--Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is
   heard of him?

   Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what
   his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I
   have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.--If ye love me,
   keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you
   another Comforter that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit
   of truth.

   The Spirit . . . maketh intercession for the saints according to the
   will of God.--ROM. 8:27.

   Verily, verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my
   name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name:
   ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.--Praying always
   with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit.

   This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing
   according to his will, he heareth us; and if we know that he hear us,
   whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired
   of him.--This is the will of God, even your sanctification.

   God hath . . . called us . . . unto holiness: . . . who hath also given
   unto us his Holy Spirit.

   Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In every thing give thanks: for
   this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. Quench not the
   Spirit.

   See that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming

   Take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, to love the Lord
   your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments,
   and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with
   all your soul.--Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming
   the time. Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt,
   that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.--Abstain from all
   appearance of evil.

   While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. And at

   which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.

   First the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the

   JUNE 17 MORNING

   In every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
   requests be made known unto God.--PHI. 4:6.

   I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.
   Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon
   him as long as I live.

   When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they
   think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.--The Spirit . .
   . helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as
   we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with
   groanings which cannot be uttered.

   I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands,
   without wrath and doubting.--Praying always with all prayer and

   Thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark, and there I will meet

   The way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest.--Jesus, when
   he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And,
   behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
   bottom.

   Having . . . brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood
   of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us,
   through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; . . . let us draw near
   with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts
   sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure
   water.--Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
   may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

   Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation [mercy seat]

   Faith as a grain of mustard seed.--MATT. 17:20.

   Barak said unto [Deborah], if thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but
   if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go. God subdued on that
   day Jabin the king of Canaan.--Gideon . . . feared his father's
   household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, . .
   . did it by night. And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel
   by mine hand as thou hast said, . . . let me prove, I pray thee. And
   God did so.

   Thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied
   my name.--Who hath despised the day of small things?

   We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet,
   because that your faith groweth exceedingly.--Lord, increase our
   faith.--I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily,
   cast forth his roots as Lebanon. His branches shall spread, and his
   beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.

   Holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.--HEB. 12:14.

   Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.--There
   shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth.--There is no
   spot in thee.

   Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy.--As obedient
   children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in
   your ignorance: but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy
   in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I
   am holy. And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons
   judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning
   here in fear.--Put off concerning the former conversation the old man,
   which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in
   the spirit of your mind, and . . . put on the new man, which after God
   is created in righteousness and true holiness.--He hath chosen us in
   him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and

   JUNE 19 EVENING

   Gold tried in the fire.--REV. 3:18.

   There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or
   father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the
   gospel's, but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,
   and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with
   persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.

   Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to
   try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you.--Now for a
   season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:
   that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold
   that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto
   praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.

   The God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by
   Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect,
   stablish, strengthen, settle you.--In the world ye shall have
   tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.

   Mark 10:29,30.I Pet. 4:12. -I Pet. 1:6,7.I Pet.5:10. -John 16:33.

   JUNE 20 MORNING

   Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy
   wages.--EXO. 2:9.

   Go ye . . . into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give
   you.--Whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name,
   because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose
   his reward.--The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth
   shall be watered also himself.--God is not unrighteous to forget your
   work and labour of love, . . . in that ye have ministered to the
   saints, and do minister.

   Every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.

   Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave
   thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked,
   and clothed thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, . . .
   Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren,
   ye have done it unto me. Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
   kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

   Matt. 20:4. -Mark 9:41. -Prov. 11:25. -Heb. 6:10.I Cor. 3:8.Matt. 25:37,38,40,34.

   JUNE 20 EVENING

   Thou compassest my path and my lying down.--PSA. 139:3.

   Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this
   place; and I knew it not. And he was afraid and said, How dreadful is
   this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the
   gate of heaven.

   The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew
   himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.

   I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, Lord, only,
   makest me dwell in safety.

   Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most
   High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall
   any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For He shall give his angels charge
   over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.--When thou liest down, thou
   shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be
   sweet.--So he giveth his beloved sleep.

   Gen. 28:16,17.II Chr. 16:9.Psa. 4:8.Psa. 91:9-11. -Prov. 3:24. -Psa. 127:2.

   JUNE 21 MORNING

   Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example that ye should follow his
   steps.--I PET 2:21.

   Even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
   minister.--Whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of
   all.

   Jesus of Nazareth . . . went about doing good.--Bear ye one another's
   burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

   The meekness and gentleness of Christ.--In lowliness of mind let each
   esteem other better than themselves.

   Father, forgive them: for they know not what they do.--Be ye kind one
   to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for
   Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

   He that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as
   he walked.--Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith;
   who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising
   the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

   Mark 10:45. -Mark 10:44.Acts 10:38. -Gal. 6:2.II Cor. 10:1. -Phi. 2:3.Luke 23:34. -Eph. 4:32.I John 2:6. -Heb. 12:2.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JUNE 21 EVENING

   I sought him, but I could not find him: I called him, but he gave me no
   answer.--SONG 5:6.

   O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their
   enemies! and the Lord said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest
   thou thus upon thy face? Israel hath sinned, for they have even taken
   of the accursed thing . . . and they have put it even among their own
   stuff.

   Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither
   his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: but your iniquities have separated
   between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you,
   that he will not hear.

   If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.

   Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward
   God. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
   commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.

   Josh. 7:8,10,11.Isa. 59:1,2.Psa. 66:18.I John 3:21,22,.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JUNE 22 MORNING

   Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.--COL. 3:3.

   How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?--I am
   crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I but Christ liveth
   in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith
   of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.--He died for
   all, that they which live should not live unto themselves, but unto him
   which died for them and rose again.--If any man be in Christ, he is a
   new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become
   new.

   We are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.--As thou,
   Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.--Ye
   are the body of Christ, and members in particular.--Because I live, ye
   shall live also.

   To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and wilt
   give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no
   man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.

   Rom. 6:2. -Gal. 2:20. -II Cor. 5:15. -II Cor. 5:17.I John 5:20. -John 17:21. -I Cor. 12:27. -John 14:19.Rev. 2:17.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JUNE 22 EVENING

   Behold how he loved.--JOHN 11:36.

   He died for all.--Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay
   down his life for his friends.

   He . . . liveth to make intercession for them.--I go to prepare a place
   for you.

   I will come again, and receive you unto myself that where I am, there
   ye may be also.--Father, I will that they whom thou hast given me, be
   with me where I am.--Having loved his own which were in the world, he
   loved them unto the end.

   We love him, because he first loved loved us.--The love of Christ
   constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then
   were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should
   not henceforth live unto themselves, but to him which died for them,
   and rose again.

   If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have
   kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.

   II Cor. 5:15. -John 15:13.Heb. 7:25. -John 14:2.John 14:3. -John 17:24.

     __________________________________________________________________

   JUNE 23 MORNING

   I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, even
   the Spirit of truth.--JOHN 14:16,17.

   It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the
   Comforter will not come unto you; but if l depart, I will send him unto
   you.

   The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the
   children of God.--Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to
   fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
   Abba, Father.--The Spirit . . . helpeth our infirmities; for we know
   not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
   intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

   The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye
   may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.--Hope maketh
   not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by
   the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

   Hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us, because he hath given
   us of his Spirit.

   JUNE 23 EVENING

   Shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?--RUTH 3:1.

   There remaineth . . . a rest to the people of God.--My people shall
   dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet
   resting places.--There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the
   weary be at rest.--They . . . rest from their labours.

   The forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for
   ever after the order of Melchisedec.

   Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
   you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
   lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is
   easy, and my burden is light.--In returning and rest shall ye be saved;
   in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.

   The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in
   green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.

   JUNE 24 MORNING

   The ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them to search out a
   resting place for them.--NUM. 10:33.

   My times are in thy hand.--He shall choose our inheritance for
   us.--Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness; . . . make thy way straight
   before my face.

   Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shalt bring it
   to pass.--In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
   paths.--Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the
   way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to
   the left.

   The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in
   green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still waters.--Like as a
   father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.
   For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.--Your
   heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.--Casting
   all your care upon him; for he careth for you.

   JUNE 24 EVENING

   Master, where dwellest thou? He saith unto them, Come and see.--JOHN 1:38,39.

   In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have
   told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a
   place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that
   where I am, there ye may be also.--To him that overcometh will I grant
   to sit with me in my throne.

   Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name
   is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a
   contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to
   revive the heart of the contrite ones.

   Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and
   open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he
   with me.

   Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.--How excellent
   is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their
   trust under the shadow of thy wings.

   John 14:2,3. -Rev. 3:21.Isa. 57:15.Rev. 3:20.Matt. 28:20. -Psa. 36:7.

   JUNE 25 MORNING

   When he shall appear, we shall be like him; we shall see him as he
   is.--I JOHN 3:2.

   As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of
   God, even to them that believe on his name.--Whereby are given unto us
   exceeding great and precious promises; that by these we might be
   partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is
   in the world through lust.

   Since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by
   the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, that he hath
   prepared for him that waiteth for him.

   Now we see through a glass. darkly; but then face to face: now I know
   in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.--Christ . . .
   shall change our vile body . . . that it may be fashioned like unto his
   glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to
   subdue all things unto himself.--As for me, I will behold thy face in
   righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

   JUNE 25 EVENING

   The man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts.--ZECH. 13:7.

   In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.--I have laid
   help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the
   people.--I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there
   was none with me.

   Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh.--Unto
   us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be
   upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor,
   The mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.

   The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and
   upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself
   purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on
   high.--Unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever.

   Let all the angels of God worship him.

   Kings of kings, and Lord of lords.

   JUNE 26 MORNING

   Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and that thou wouldest keep me
   from evil! And God granted him that which he requested.--I CHR. 4:10.

   The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with
   it.--When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he
   hideth his face, who then can behold him?

   Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing is upon thy
   people.--How great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
   that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee
   before the sons of men.--I pray not that thou shouldest take them out
   of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

   Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
   shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he
   that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.--The
   Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in
   him shall be desolate.

   JUNE 26 EVENING

   It is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them out
   from the land of Egypt.--EXO. 12:42.

   The Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: and
   when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my
   body which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the
   same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup
   is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in
   remembrance of me.

   He . . . kneeled down, and prayed. And being in an agony he prayed more
   earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling
   down to the ground.

   It was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: . . .
   they took Jesus, and led him away, . . . into a place called . . .
   Golgotha: where they crucified him.

   Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the
   feast.

   JUNE 27 MORNING

   Who shall be able to stand?--REV. 6:17.

   Who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he
   appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap.

   I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all
   nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, stood before the
   throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in
   their hands. These are they which came out of great tribulation, and
   have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
   They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more: neither shall the
   sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of
   the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains
   of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

   There is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk
   not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.--Stand fast therefore in the
   liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free.

   Mal. 3:2.Rev. 7:9,14-17.Rom. 8:1. -Gal. 5:1.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JUNE 27 EVENING

   Enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man
   living be justified.--PSA. 143:2.

   Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins
   be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
   crimson, they shall be as wool.

   Let him take hold of my strength that he may make peace with me; and he
   shall make peace with me.--Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at
   peace.

   Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
   Christ.--A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the
   faith of Jesus Christ.--By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
   justified in his sight.

   By him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye
   could not be justified by the law of Moses.

   Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   JUNE 28 MORNING

   I know that my Redeemer liveth.--JOB 19:25.

   If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his
   Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.--This
   man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
   Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto
   God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.

   Because I live, ye shall live also.--If in this life only we have hope
   in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen
   from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.

   The Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from
   transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord.--We have redemption through his
   blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his
   grace.--Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and
   gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your
   fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
   blemish and without spot.

   Rom. 5:10. -Heb. 7:24,25.John 14:19. -I Cor. 15:19,20.Isa. 59:20. -Eph. 1:7. -I Pet. 1:18,19.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JUNE 28 EVENING

   The Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall
   depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits.--I TIM. 4:1.

   Take heed therefore how ye hear.--Let the word of Christ dwell in you
   richly in all wisdom.--Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith
   ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

   Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend
   them. How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to
   my mouth! Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate
   every false way.

   Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.--I have more
   understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my
   meditation.

   Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.--But though we, or
   an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which
   we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.

   JUNE 29 MORNING

   His commandments are not grievous.--I JOHN 5:3.

   This is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the
   Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life.--Whatsoever we
   ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those
   things that are pleasing in his sight.

   My yoke is easy, and my burden is light.--If ye love me, keep my
   commandments. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is
   that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and
   I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

   Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
   understanding.--Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths
   are peace.--Great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall
   offend them.--I delight in the law of God after the inward man.

   This is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son
   Jesus Christ, and love one another.--Love worketh no ill to his
   neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.

   JUNE 29 EVENING

   Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions.--PSA. 25:7.

   I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a
   cloud, thy sins.--I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions
   for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.--Come now, and let
   us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet,
   they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they
   shall be as wool.--I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember
   their sin no more.--Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of
   the sea.

   Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption:
   for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.--Who is a God like unto
   thee, that pardoneth iniquity? . . . he retaineth not his anger for
   ever, because he delighteth in mercy.--Unto him that loved us, and
   washed us from our sins in his own blood, to him be glory and dominion

   As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.--REV. 3:19.

   My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when
   thou art rebuked of him: for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and
   scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.--Even as a father the son in
   whom he delighteth.--He maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and
   his hands make whole.--Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty
   hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.--I have chosen thee in
   the furnace of affliction.

   He doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.--He hath
   not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our
   iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
   mercy toward them that fear him. As far as the east is from the west,
   so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. Like as a father
   pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. For he
   knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

   Heb. 12:5,6. -Prov. 3:12. -Job 5:18. -I Pet. 5:6. -Isa. 48:10.Lam. 3:33. -Psa. 103:10-14.

   JUNE 30 EVENING

   God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be
   few.--ECCL. 5:2.

   When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they
   think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye
   therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have
   need of, before ye ask him.

   They . . . called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon,
   saying, O Baal, hear us.

   Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the
   other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God,
   I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,
   adulterers, or even as this publican. And the publican, standing afar
   off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon
   his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this
   man went down to his house justified rather than the other.

   Lord, teach us to pray.

   Matt. 6:7,8.I Kgs. 18:26.Luke 18:10,11,13,14.Luke 11:1.

   JULY 1 MORNING

   The fruit ot the Spirit is goodness.--GAL. 5:22.

   Be ye . . . followers of God, as dear children.--Love your enemies,
   bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for
   them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the
   children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to
   rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on
   the unjust.--Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

   The fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth.

   After that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man
   appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
   according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and
   renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through
   Jesus Christ our Saviour.--The Lord is good to all: and his tender
   mercies are over all his works.--He that spared not his own Son, but
   delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give
   us all things?

   Eph. 5:1. -Matt. 5:44,45. -Luke 6:36.Eph. 5:9.Tit. 3:4-6. -Psa. 145:9.
   -Rom. 8:32.

   JULY 1 EVENING

   Ebenezer . . . Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.--I SAM. 7:12.

   I was brought low, and he helped me.--Blessed be the Lord, because he
   hath heard the voice of my supplications. The Lord is my strength and
   my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart
   greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.

   It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man. It is
   better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes.--Happy
   is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the
   Lord his God.--He led them forth by the right way, that they might go
   to a city of habitation.--There failed not ought of any good thing
   which the Lord hath spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.

   When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any
   thing? And they said, Nothing.--Because thou hast been my help,
   therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.

   Psa. 116:6. -Psa. 28:6,7.Psa. 118:8,9. -Psa. 146:5, -Psa. 107:7. -Josh. 21:45.Luke 22:35. -Psa. 63:7.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 2 MORNING

   This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat
   thereof.--EXO. 12:43.

   We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the
   tabernacle.--Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
   God.--At that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the
   commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise.
   But now, in Christ Jesus, ye who sometime were far off, are made nigh
   by the blood of Christ.

   For he is our peace, who hath made both one, . . . having abolished in
   his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in
   ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making
   peace.

   Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
   fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God.

   If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and
   will sup with him, and he with me.

   Heb. 13:10. -John 3:3. -Eph. 2:12,13.Eph. 2:14,15.Eph. 2:19.Rev. 3:20.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 2 EVENING

   [Jesus] prayed the third time, saying the same words.--MATT. 26:44.

   Who in the days of his flesh . . . offered up prayers and supplications
   with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from
   death.

   Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.--Continuing
   instant in prayer.--Praying always with all prayer and supplication in
   the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and
   supplication.--By prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your
   requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth
   all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ
   Jesus.

   Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.--This is the confidence
   that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will,
   he heareth us.

   Delight thyself . . . in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires
   of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he
   shall bring it to pass.

   Heb. 5:7.Hos. 6:3. -Rom. 12:12. -Eph. 6:18. -Phi. 4:6,7.Matt. 26:39. -I

   JULY 3 MORNING

   If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
   Christ.--ROM. 8:17.

   If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to
   the promise.

   Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we
   should be called the sons of God.--Thou art no more a servant, but a
   son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.--Having
   predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
   himself, according to the good pleasure of his will.

   Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me
   where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me.

   He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him I will
   give power over the nations.--To him that overcometh will I grant to
   sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with
   my Father in his throne.

   Gal. 3:29.I John 3:l. -Gal. 4:7. -Eph. 1:5.John 17:24.Rev. 2:26. -Rev. 3:21.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 3 EVENING

   Things which are despised, hath God chosen.--I COR. 1:28.

   Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?

   Jesus, . . . saw two brethren, . . . casting a net into the sea: for
   they were fishers. And he saith unto them, Follow me.--Now when they
   saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were
   unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of
   them, that they had been with Jesus.

   My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom,
   but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: that your faith should
   not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

   Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye
   should go and bring forth fruit. He that abideth in me, and I in him,
   the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do
   nothing.--We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency
   of the power may be of God.

   Acts 2:7.Matt. 4:18,19. -Acts 4:13.I Cor. 2:4,5.John 15:16,5. -II Cor. 4:7.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 4 MORNING

   Leaning on Jesus' bosom.--JOHN 13:23.

   As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you.--They brought
   young children to him, that he should touch them. And he took them up
   in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.--Jesus called
   his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude,
   because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat;
   and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.--A
   high Priest . . . touched with the feeling of our infirmities.--In his
   love and in his pity he redeemed them.

   I will not leave you comfortless: (marg. orphans) I will come to
   you.--Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
   compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not
   forget thee.

   The Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall
   lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all
   tears from their eyes.

   Isa. 66:13. -Mark 10:13,16. -Matt. 15:32. -Heb. 4:15. -Isa. 63:9.John 14:18. -Isa. 49:15.Rev. 7:17.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 4 EVENING

   Jesus Christ the righteous: the propitiation for our sins.--I JOHN 2:1,2.

   Toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be. And thou
   shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt
   put the testimony that I shall give thee. I will meet with thee, and I
   will commune with thee from above the mercy seat.

   Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; mercy and truth are
   met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.

   If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? But
   there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. Let Israel
   hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is
   plenteous redemption. And he shall redeem Israel from all his
   iniquities.--All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being
   justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ
   Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
   his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins.

   Exo. 25:20-22.Psa. 85:9,10.Psa. 130:3,4,7,8. -Rom. 3:23-25.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 5 MORNING

   We have known and believed the love that God hath to us.--I JOHN 4:16.

   God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
   even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ,
   (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together, and made us
   sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to
   come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness
   toward us through Christ Jesus.

   God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
   whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life.--He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,
   how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?--The Lord is
   good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.

   We love him, because he first loved us.

   Blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those
   things which were told her from the Lord.

   Eph. 2:4-7.John 3:16. -Rom. 8:32. -Psa. 145:9.I John 4:19.Luke 1:45.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 5 EVENING

   Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate.--ROM. 12:16.

   My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of
   glory, with respect of persons. Hath not God chosen the poor of this
   world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to
   them that love him?

   Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.--Having food
   and raiment let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich
   fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful
   lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.

   God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise:
   and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things
   which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are
   despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to
   nought things that are: that no flesh should glory in his presence.

   Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty.

   Jas. 2:1,5.I Cor. 10:24. -I Tim. 6:8,9.I Cor. 1:27-29.Psa. 131:1.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 6 MORNING

   Let your speech be always with grace.--COL. 4:6.

   A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. As an
   earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover
   upon an obedient ear.--Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your
   mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may
   minister grace unto the hearers.--A good man out of the good treasure
   of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the
   evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.--By thy words thou shalt be
   justified.--The tongue of the wise is health.

   They that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord
   hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before
   him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.

   If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my
   mouth.--Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and
   utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, . . . see that ye
   abound in this grace also.

   Prov. 25:11,12. -Eph. 4:29. -Matt. 12:35. -Matt. 12:37. -Prov. 12:18.Mal. 3:16.Jer. 15:19. -II Cor. 8:7.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 6 EVENING

   Thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes.--PSA. 26:3.

   The Lord is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of
   great mercy.--Your Father which is in heaven: . . . maketh his sun to
   rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on
   the unjust.

   Be ye . . . followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love, as
   Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering
   and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.--Be ye kind to one
   another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's
   sake hath forgiven you.--Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying
   the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see
   that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently.--The love of
   Christ constraineth us.

   Love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again;
   and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the
   Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. Be ye
   therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

   Psa. 145:8. -Matt. 5:45.Eph. 5:1,2. -Eph. 4:32. -I Pet. 1:22. -II Cor. 5:14.Luke 6:35,36.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 7 MORNING

   Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
   of the devil.--MATT. 4:1.

   In the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and
   supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to
   save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; though he were a
   Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and
   being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all
   them that obey him.--We have not an high priest which cannot be touched
   with the feeling of our infirmities: but was in all points tempted like
   as we are, yet without sin.

   There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but
   God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye
   are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that
   ye may be able to bear it.--My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
   strength is made perfect in weakness.

   Heb. 5:7-9. -Heb. 4:15.I Cor. 10:13. -II Cor. 12:9.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 7 EVENING

   The Son of man came to give his life a ransom for many.--MATT. 20:28.

   If the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer
   sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: how
   much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit
   offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead
   works to serve the living God?

   He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter.--I lay down my life for the
   sheep. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have
   power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.

   The life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon
   the altar, to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood
   that maketh an atonement for the soul.--Without shedding of blood is no
   remission.

   While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being
   now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.

   Heb. 9:13,14.Isa. 53:7. -John 10:15,18.Lev. 17:11. -Heb. 9:22.Rom. 5:8,9.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 8 MORNING

   If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
   and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.--I JOHN 1:9.

   I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against
   thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight.

   And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way
   off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his
   neck, and kissed him.--I have blotted out as a thick cloud, thy
   transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have
   redeemed thee.--Your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.--God
   for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.--That he might be just, and the
   justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

   Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean.--They
   shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.

   This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ: not by
   water only, but by water and blood.

   Psa. 51:3,4.Luke 15:20. -Isa. 44:22. -I John 2:12. -Eph. 4:32. -Rom. 3:26.Eze. 36:25. -Rev. 3:4.I John 5:6.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 8 EVENING

   Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee?--PSA. 94:20.

   Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus
   Christ.--Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet
   appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we
   shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man that
   hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.

   The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.--An high
   priest . . . holy, harmless, undefiled.

   We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
   against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
   against spiritual wickedness in high places.--The prince of the power
   of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of
   disobedience.

   Whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God
   keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. And we know that
   we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.

   I John 1:3. -I John 3:2,3.John 14:30. -Heb. 7:26.Eph 6:12. -Eph. 2:2.I

     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 9 MORNING

   I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee
   with change of raiment.--ZECH. 3:4.

   Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
   covered.--We are all as an unclean thing.--I know that in me (that is,
   in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me;
   but how to perform that which is good I find not.

   As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
   Christ.--Ye have put off the old man with his deeds; and have put on
   the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that
   created him.--Not having mine own righteousness which is of the law,
   but . . . the righteousness which is of God by faith.

   Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him.--The fine linen is the
   righteousness of saints.--I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul
   shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of
   salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness.

   Psa. 32:1. -Isa. 64:6. -Rom. 7:18.Gal. 3:27. -Col. 3:9,10. -Phi. 3:9.Luke 15:22. -Rev. 19:8. -Isa. 61:10.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 9 EVENING

   The day shall declare it.--I COR. 3:13.

   Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring
   to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the
   counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.

   Why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy
   brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. So
   then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. Let us not
   therefore judge one another any more.

   God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.--The Father judgeth
   no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: and hath given
   him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.

   The Great, the Mighty God, the Lord of hosts, is his name, great in
   counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways
   of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and
   according to the fruit of his doings.

   I Cor. 4:5.Rom. 14:10,12,13.Rom. 2:16. -John 5:22,27.Jer. 32:18,19.

   JULY 10 MORNING

   The disciple is not above his master.--MATT. 10:24.

   Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.

   It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant
   as his lord.--If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you;
   if they have kept my saying, they will keep your's also.--I have given
   them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of
   the world, even as I am not of the world.

   Consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against
   himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. Ye have not yet
   resisted unto blood, striving against sin.

   Let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto
   Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was
   set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down
   at the right hand of the throne of God.--Forasmuch . . . as Christ hath
   suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same
   mind.

   John 13:13.Matt. 10:25. -John 15:20. -John 17:14.Heb. 12:3,4.Heb. 12:1,2. -I Pet. 4:1.

   JULY 10 EVENING

   My son, give me thine heart.--PROV. 23:26.

   O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and
   keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and
   with their children for ever!

   Thy heart is not right in the sight of God.--Because the carnal mind is
   enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
   indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

   They . . . first gave their own selves to the Lord.--In every work that
   [Hezekiah] began . . . to seek his God, he did it with all his heart,
   and prospered.

   Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of
   life.

   Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord.--As the servants of
   Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing
   service, as to the Lord, and not to men.

   I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my
   heart.

   JULY 11 MORNING

   I am with thee to save thee.--JER. 15:20.

   Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
   delivered? But thus saith the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty
   shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered:
   for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee. And all flesh
   shall know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty
   One of Jacob.--Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for
   I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I
   will uphold thee with the right hand of my rightousness.

   We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of
   our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
   without sin.--In that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is
   able to succour them that are tempted.--The steps of a good man are
   ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he
   shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his
   hand.

   Isa. 49:24-26. -Isa. 41:10.Heb. 4:15. -Heb. 2:18. -Psa. 37:23,24.

   JULY 11 EVENING

   He satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with
   goodness.--PSA. 107:9.

   Ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

   O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for
   thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no
   water is; to see thy power and thy glory.--My soul longeth, yea, even
   fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out
   for the living God.--Having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ;
   which is far better.

   I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.--They shall
   hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on
   them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne
   shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters:
   and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.--They shall be
   abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make
   them drink of the river of thy pleasures.--My people shall be satisfied
   with my goodness, saith the Lord.

   JULY 12 MORNING

   My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.--EXO. 33:14.

   Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for
   the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail
   thee, nor forsake thee. The Lord, he it is that doth go before thee; he
   will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear
   not, neither be dismayed.--Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of
   a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord
   thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.--In all thy ways
   acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

   He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may
   boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall
   do unto me.--Our sufficiency is of God.

   Lead us not into temptation.--O Lord, I know that the way of man is not
   in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.--My
   times are in thy hand.

   Deut. 31:6,8. -Josh. 1:9. -Prov. 3:6.Heb. 13:5,6. -II Cor. 3:5.Matt. 6:13. -Jer. 10:23. -Psa. 31:15.

   JULY 12 EVENING

   Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good
   works.--HEB. 10:24.

   How forcible are right words!--I stir up your pure minds by way of
   remembrance.

   They that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord
   hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before
   him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.--If
   two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall
   ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.

   The Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone.--Two
   are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.
   For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that
   is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.

   Let . . . no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his
   brother's way.--Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of
   Christ. Considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.

   Job 6:25. -II Pet. 3:1.Mal. 3:16. -Matt. 18:19.Gen. 2:18. -Eccl. 4:9,10.Rom. 14:13. -Gal. 6:2,1.

   JULY 13 MORNING

   I am my Beloved's, and His desire is toward me.--SONG 7:10.

   I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep
   that which I have committed unto him against that day.--I am persuaded,
   that neither death, nor life, nor angels nor principalities, nor
   powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth,
   nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of
   God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.--Those that thou gavest me I
   have kept, and none of then is lost.

   The Lord taketh pleasure in his people.--My delights were with the sons
   of men.--His great love wherewith he loved us.--Greater love hath no
   man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.

   Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in
   your spirit, which are God's.--Whether we live, we live unto the Lord;
   and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or
   die, we are the Lord's.

   JULY 13 EVENING

   Seek ye out of the book of the Lord.--ISA. 34:16.

   Ye shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind
   them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between
   your eyes.--This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but
   thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to
   do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make
   thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.

   The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.--By
   the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the
   destroyer.--Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin
   against thee.

   We have . . . a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that
   ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the
   day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.--That we through
   patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.

   Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.--MATT. 12:34.

   Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.

   Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of
   life.--Death and life are in the power of the tongue. --The mouth of
   the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment. The
   law of his God is in his heart: none of his steps shall slide.--Let no
   corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good
   to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.

   We cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.--I
   believed, therefore have I spoken.

   Whosoever . . . shall confess me before men, him will I confess also
   before my Father which is in heaven.--With the heart man believeth unto
   righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

   JULY 14 EVENING

   I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face.--III JOHN 14.

   Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come
   down!--As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul
   after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when
   shall I come and appear before God?--Make haste, my beloved, and be
   thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.

   Our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the
   Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.--Looking for that blessed hope, and the
   glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.--God
   our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope.--Whom having not
   seen, ye love.

   He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly; Amen.
   Even so, come, Lord Jesus.--It shall be said in that day, Lo, this is
   our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord;
   we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

   Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.--MATT. 6:10.

   Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his
   commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the Lord,
   all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.

   I came down from heaven not to do mine own will, but the will of him
   that sent me.--I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is
   within my heart.--O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me,
   except I drink it, thy will be done.

   Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
   kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
   heaven.--Not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers
   of the law shall be justified.--If ye know these things, happy are ye
   if ye do them.--To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to
   him it is sin.

   Be not conformed to this world: but ye be transformed by the renewing
   of your mind.

   The ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.--JOB 34:3.

   Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are
   of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.--Judge
   not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.--I speak
   as to wise men; judge ye what I say.--Let the word of Christ dwell in
   you richly in all wisdom.

   He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith.--He that is
   spiritual judgeth all things.

   Take heed what ye hear.--I know thy works, . . . and how thou hast
   tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found
   them liars.--Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.

   He calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he
   putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow
   him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but
   will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.

   Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.--EXO. 19:6.

   Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every
   kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our
   God kings and priests.--Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood,
   a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises
   of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.

   Ye shall be named the Priests of the Lord: men shall call you the
   Ministers of our God.--Priests of God and of Christ.

   Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider
   the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus.--By him
   therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that
   is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.

   For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
   which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.--The temple
   of God is holy, which temple ye are.

   JULY 16 EVENING

   We made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them.--NEH. 4:9.

   Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.--Continue in prayer,
   and watch in the same with thanksgiving.--Casting all your care upon
   him; for he careth for you. Be sober, be vigilant; because your
   adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he
   may devour: whom resist stedfast in the faith.

   Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?--Be ye
   doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.

   Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that
   they go forward.

   Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication
   with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the
   peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts
   and minds through Christ Jesus.

   JULY 17 MORNING

   Thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
   kindness, and repentest thee of the evil--JON. 4:2.

   I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou
   hast spoken, saying, The Lord is longsuffering, and of great mercy,
   forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the
   guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the
   third and fourth generation.

   O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies
   speedily prevent us. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of
   thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's
   sake.--Lord, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for
   thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against
   thee.--We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our
   fathers: for we have sinned against thee.

   If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? But
   there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.

   JULY 17 EVENING

   Sanctification of the Spirit.--II THES. 2:13.

   Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that
   the spices thereof may flow out.

   Behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what
   carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea,
   what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what
   zeal, yea, what revenge!--Fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and
   righteousness and truth: proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

   The Comforter is the Holy Ghost.--The love of God is shed abroad in our
   hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

   The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.

   In a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their
   deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.

   All these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every
   man severally as he will.

   JULY 18 MORNING

   He calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.--JOHN 10:3.

   The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth
   them that are his; and, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ,
   depart from iniquity.--Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord,
   have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out
   devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I
   profess unto them, I never knew you . . . depart from me, ye that work
   iniquity.--The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way of
   the ungodly shall perish.

   Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are
   continually before me.--Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal
   upon thine arm.--The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble;
   and he knoweth them that trust in him.

   I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for
   you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am,
   there ye may be also.

   This poor widow hath cast in more than they all.--Whosoever shall give
   you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ,
   verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.--If there be first
   a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not
   according to that he hath not.

   Let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in
   truth.--If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
   and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled;
   notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the
   body; what doth it profit?--He which soweth bountifully, shall reap
   also bountifully. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so
   let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a
   cheerful giver.

   When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say,
   We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to
   do.

   Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee,
   glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?--Among the
   gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works

   The dew of Hermon.--PSA. 133:3.

   Mount Sion, which is Hermon.--There the Lord commanded the blessing,
   even life for evermore.--I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall
   grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.

   My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew,
   as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the
   grass.--As the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and
   returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring
   forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the
   eater: so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall
   not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please,
   and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.

   God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.--And of his fulness have
   all we received, and grace for grace.--It is like the precious ointment
   upon the head . . . even Aaron's . . . that went down to the skirts of
   his garments.

   JULY 20 MORNING

   They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.--JOHN 17:16.

   He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted
   with grief.--In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good
   cheer; I have overcome the world.

   Such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled,
   separate from sinners.--That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons
   of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation.

   Jesus of Nazareth . . . went about doing good, and healing all that
   were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.--As we have
   therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto
   them who are of the household of faith.

   That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the
   world.--Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill
   cannot be hid. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see
   your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

   He that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.--PROV. 15:15.

   The joy of the Lord is your strength.--The kingdom of God is not meat
   and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.--Be
   filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and
   spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
   giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name
   of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   By him . . . let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually,
   that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.

   Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the
   vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield
   no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be

   the God of my salvation.--Sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing.--We glory in
   tribulations also.

   JULY 21 MORNING

   What profit is there of circumcision?--ROM. 3:1.

   Much every way.--Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the
   foreskins of your heart.--If . . . their uncircumcised hearts be
   humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: then
   will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with
   Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember.

   Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God,
   to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.--In whom also ye are
   circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off
   the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.--You,
   being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he
   quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses.

   Put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is
   corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit
   of your mind; and . . . put on the new man, which after God is created

   JULY 21 EVENING

   The veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
   bottom.--MATT. 27:51.

   The Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: and
   when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my
   body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.--The bread
   that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the
   world.

   Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have
   no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath
   eternal life. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth
   in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by
   the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. Doth this
   offend you? What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he
   was before? It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
   nothing.

   A new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the
   veil, that is to say, his flesh; let us draw near.

   I Cor. 11:23,24. -John 6:51.John 6:53,54,56,57,61-63.Heb. 10:20,22.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 22 MORNING

   In that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he
   liveth unto God.--ROM. 6:10.

   He was numbered with the transgressors.--Christ was once offered to
   bear the sins of many.--Who his own self bare our sins in his own body
   on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto
   righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.--By one offering he
   hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.

   This man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
   Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto
   God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.--While
   we were yet sinners Christ died for us. Much more then, being now
   justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.

   Forasmuch . . . as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm
   yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in
   the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live the rest
   of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.

   Isa. 53:12. -Heb. 9:28.I Pet. 2:24. -Heb. 10:14.Heb. 7:24,25. -Rom. 5:8,9.I Pet. 4:1,2.

   JULY 22 EVENING

   Keep yourselves in the love of God.--JUDE 21.

   Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,
   except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I
   am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him,
   the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.

   The fruit of the Spirit is love.

   Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be
   my disciples. As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you:
   continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in
   my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his
   love.--Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
   perfected.

   This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved
   you.--God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
   sinners, Christ died for us.--God is love; and he that dwelleth in love
   dwelleth in God, and God in him.

   John 15:4,5.Gal. 5:22.John 15:8-10. -I John 2:5.John 15:12. -Rom. 5:8.

   JULY 23 MORNING

   Then cometh the end.--I COR. 15:24.

   Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are
   in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Take ye heed, watch and
   pray: for ye know not when the time is. And what I say unto you I say
   unto all, Watch.--The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some
   men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that
   any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.--The coming
   of the Lord draweth nigh. The judge standeth before the door.--Surely I
   come quickly.

   Seeing . . . that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of
   persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?

   The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto
   prayer.--Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and
   ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will
   return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may
   open unto him immediately.

   Matt. 13:32,33,37. -II Pet. 3:9. -Jas. 5:8,9. -Rev. 22:20.II Pet. 3:11.I Pet. 4:7. -Luke 12:35,36.

   JULY 23 EVENING

   Brethren, pray for us.--I THES. 5:25.

   Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and
   let them pray over him. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick,
   and the Lord shall raise him up. Pray one for another, that ye may be
   healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
   Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed
   earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the
   space of three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the
   heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.

   Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and
   watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all
   saints.

   Without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.--Always
   labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and
   complete in all the will of God.

   Jas. 5:14-18.Eph. 6:18.Rom. 1:9. -Col. 4:12.

   JULY 24 MORNING

   Patient in tribulation.--ROM. 12:12.

   It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good.--Whom, though I were
   righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my
   judge.--The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the
   name of the Lord.--What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and
   shall we not receive evil?

   Jesus wept.--A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. Surely he
   hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.

   Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he
   receiveth. Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
   grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
   righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.--Strengthened with
   all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and
   longsuffering with joyfulness.--In the world ye shall have tribulation:
   but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.

   I Sam. 3:18. -Job 9:15. -Job 1:21. -Job 2:10.John 11:35. -Isa. 53:3,4.Heb. 12:6,11. -Col. l:11. -John 16:33.

   JULY 24 EVENING

   He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief.--ROM. 4:20.

   Have faith in God. Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou
   removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his
   heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to
   pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What
   things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them,
   and ye shall have them.--Without faith it is impossible to please him:
   for he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a
   rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

   He that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of
   whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: accounting
   that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead.--Being fully
   persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.

   Is any thing too hard for the Lord?--With God all things are
   possible.--Lord, increase our faith.

   Mark 11:22-24. -Heb. 11:16.Heb. 11:17-19. -Rom. 4:21.Gen. 18:14. -Matt. 19:26. -Luke 17:5.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 25 MORNING

   We know that we have passed from death unto life.--I JOHN 3:14.

   He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath
   everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed
   from death unto life.--He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath
   not the Son of God hath not life.

   He which stablisheth us with you in Christ and hath anointed us, is
   God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in
   our hearts.--Hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure
   our hearts before him. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have
   we confidence toward God.--We know that we are of God, and the whole
   world lieth in wickedness.

   You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sin.--Quickened
   . . . together with Christ.--Who hath delivered us from the power of
   darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom his dear Son.

   John 5:24. -I John 5:12.II Cor. 1:21,22. -I John 3:19,21. -I John 5:19.Eph. 2:1. -Eph. 2:5. -Col. 1:13.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 25 EVENING

   Thou wilt shew me the path of life.--PSA. 16:11.

   Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I set before you the way of life and the
   way of death.--I will teach you the good and the right way.-- I am the
   way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by
   me.--Follow me.

   There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the ends thereof are
   the ways of death.--Wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that
   leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because
   strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, that leadeth unto life, and
   few there be that find it.

   An highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of
   holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for
   those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.--Then
   shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.

   In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so I would have
   told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

   Jer. 21:8. -I Sam. 12:23. -John 14:6. -Matt. 14:19.Prov. 4:12. -Matt. 7:13,14.Isa. 35:8. -Hos. 6:3.John 14:2.

   JULY 26 MORNING

   By faith Abraham, . . . called to go out into a place which he should
   after receive for an inheritance, obeyed.--HEB. 11:8.

   He shall choose our inheritance for us.--He led him about, he
   instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye. As an eagle
   stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her
   wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the Lord alone did
   lead him, and there was no strange god with him.

   I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee
   by the way that thou shouldest go.--Who teacheth like Him?

   We walk by faith, not by sight.--Here have we no continuing city, but
   we seek one to come.--Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and
   pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the
   soul.--Arise ye and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is
   polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.

   Psa. 47:4. -Deut. 32:10-12.Isa. 48:17. -Job 36:22.II Cor. 5:7. -Heb. 13:14. -I Pet. 2:11. -Mic. 2:10.

   JULY 26 EVENING

   Give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.--PSA. 97:12.

   The heavens are not clean in his sight. How much more abominable and
   filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?--Yea, the stars are
   not pure in his sight. How much less man, that is a worm?

   Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee,
   glorious in holiness?--Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts.

   As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of
   conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am
   holy.--Partakers of his holiness.

   The temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.--What manner of persons
   ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, . . . without
   spot, and blameless?

   Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which
   is good to the use of edifying. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God,
   whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.

   JULY 27 MORNING

   Christ, who is the image of God.--II COR. 4:4.

   The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
   together.--No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son,
   which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. And the Word
   was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory
   as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.--He
   that hath seen me hath seen the Father.--The brightness of his glory,
   and the express image of his person.--God was manifest in the flesh.

   In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of
   sins: who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
   creature.--Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
   conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among
   many brethren.

   As we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image
   of the heavenly.

   Isa. 40:5. -John 1:18,14. -John 14:9. -Heb. 1:3. -I Tim. 3:16.Col. 1:14,15. -Rom. 8:29.I Cor. 15:49.

   JULY 27 EVENING

   Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle.--PSA. 18:39.

   When I am weak, then am I strong.

   Asa cried unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord, it is nothing with
   thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help
   us, O Lord our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against
   this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God; let not man prevail against
   thee.--Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord helped him.

   It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man. It is
   better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes.--There
   is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not
   delivered by much strength. An horse is a vain thing for safety:
   neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.

   We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
   against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
   against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you
   the whole armour of God.

   II Cor. 12:10.II Chr. 14:11. -II Chr. 18:31.Psa. 118:8,9. -Psa. 33:16,17.Eph. 6:12,13.

   JULY 28 MORNING

   Walk in love.--EPH. 5:2.

   A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have
   loved you, that ye also love one another.--Above all things have
   fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude
   of sins.--Love covereth all sins.

   When ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your
   Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.--Love
   ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing
   again.--Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart
   be glad when he stumbleth.--Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for
   railing: but contrar-wise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto
   called, that ye should inherit a blessing.--If it be possible, as much
   as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.--Be ye kind one to
   another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for
   Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

   My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in
   deed and in truth.

   JULY 28 EVENING

   Let your requests be made known unto God.--PHIL. 4:6.

   Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup
   from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.--There was
   given to me a thorn in the flesh. For this thing I besought the Lord
   thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is
   sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most
   gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities.

   I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my
   trouble.--Hannah . . . was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the
   Lord, and wept sore. And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if
   thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and . . .
   wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto
   the Lord all the days of his life. The Lord remembered her.

   We know not what we should pray for as we ought.--He shall choose our
   inheritance for us.

   Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come
   down.--ISA. 64:1.

   Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart
   upon the mountains of spices.--We ourselves groan within ourselves,
   waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.--Bow thy
   heavens, O Lord, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall
   smoke.

   This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come
   in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.--Unto them that look
   for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.--It
   shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him,
   and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will
   be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

   He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen.
   Even so, come, Lord Jesus.--That blessed hope . . . the glorious
   appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.--Our
   conversation is in heaven.

   JULY 29 EVENING

   Thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.--PSA. 61:5.

   No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue
   that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is
   the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of
   me, saith the Lord.--The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them
   that fear him, and delivereth them. O taste and see that the Lord is
   good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. O fear the Lord, ye his
   saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. The young lions do
   lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not want any
   good thing.--The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I
   have a goodly heritage.

   Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with
   healing in his wings: and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of
   the stall.--He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
   all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

     __________________________________________________________________

   JULY 30 MORNING

   Seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right
   hand of God.--COL. 3:1.

   Get wisdom, get understanding.--The wisdom that is from above.--The
   depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.--We
   are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was
   raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also
   should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in
   the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his
   resurrection.

   Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset
   us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.--God .
   . . hath quickened us together with Christ, . . . and hath raised us up
   together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.

   They that say such things declare plainly that they seek a
   country.--Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have
   wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness.

   Prov. 4:5. -Jas. 3:17. -Job 28:14. -Rom. 6:4,5.Heb. 12:1. -Eph. 2:4-6.Heb. 11:14. -Zeph. 2:3.

   JULY 30 EVENING

   Nicodemus . . . he that came to Jesus by night.--JOHN 7:50.

   Peter followed him afar off.--Among the chief rulers also many believed
   on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest
   they should be put out of the synagogue: for they loved the praise of
   men more than the praise of God.--The fear of man bringeth a snare: but
   whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.

   Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.--A bruised reed shall
   he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench.--Faith as a
   grain of mustard seed.

   God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love,
   and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of
   our Lord.--Little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear,
   we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his
   coming.--Whosoever . . . shall confess me before men, him will I
   confess also before my Father which is in heaven.

   JULY 31 MORNING

   Endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ--II TIM. 2:3.

   I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and a commander
   to the people.--It became him, for whom are all things and by whom are
   all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of
   their salvation perfect through suffering.--We must through much
   tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.

   We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
   against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
   against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you
   the whole armour of God.--We do not war after the flesh: (for the
   weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the
   pulling down of strongholds.)

   The God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by
   Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect,
   stablish, strengthen, settle you.

   JULY 31 EVENING

   The unity of the Spirit.--EPH. 4:3.

   There is one body, and one Spirit.--Through him we both have access by
   one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and
   foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints and of the household of
   God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
   Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone; in whom all the
   building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:
   in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through
   the Spirit.

   Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together
   in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down
   upon the beard, even Aaron's beard; that went down to the skirts of his
   garments.

   Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the
   Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one
   another with a pure heart fervently.

   AUGUST 1 MORNING

   The fruit of the Spirit is . . . faith.--GAL. 5:22.

   By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is
   the gift of God.--Without faith it is impossible to please him.--He
   that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is
   condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only
   begotten Son of God.--Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.

   Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected:
   hereby know we that we are in him.--Faith worketh by love.--Faith
   without works is dead.

   We walk by faith, not by sight.--I am crucified with Christ:
   nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life
   which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God,
   who loved me, and gave himself for me.--Whom having not seen, ye love;
   in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy
   unspeakable and full of glory; receiving the end of your faith, even
   the salvation of your souls.

   AUGUST 1 EVENING

   The Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.--JAS. 5:11.

   Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that
   fear him.--The Lord is gracious and full of compassion. He will ever be
   mindful of his covenant.

   He that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel
   shall neither slumber nor sleep.--As an eagle stirreth up her nest,
   fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them,
   beareth them on her wings: so the Lord alone did lead him, and there
   was no strange god with him.

   His compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy
   faithfulness.

   Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with
   compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.--The same yesterday,
   and today, and forever.

   The very hairs of your head are all numbered. Are not two sparrows sold
   for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without
   your Father. Fear ye not therefore.

   Psa. 103:13. -Psa. 111:4,5.Psa. 121:3,4. -Deut. 32:11,12.Lam. 3:22,23.Matt. 14:14. -Heb. 13:8.Matt. 10:30,29,31.

   AUGUST 2 MORNING

   The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.--REV. 13:8.

   Your lamb shall be without blemish, . . . and the whole assembly of the
   congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. And they shall
   take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper
   door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it, . . . and when I
   see the blood, I will pass over you.--The blood of sprinkling.--Christ
   our passover is sacrificed for us.--Being delivered by the determinate
   counsel and foreknowledge of God.--According to his own purpose and
   grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.

   We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.

   Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm
   yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in
   the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live the rest
   of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.

   Exo. 12:5-7,13. -Heb. 12:24. -I Cor. 5:7. -Acts 2:23. -II Tim. 1:9.Eph. 1:7.I Pet. 4:1,2.
     __________________________________________________________________

   AUGUST 2 EVENING

   I have trodden the winepress alone.--ISA. 63:3.

   Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee,
   glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?--He saw that
   there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore
   his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained
   him.--Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the
   tree.--Being made a curse for us.

   O sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvellous things:
   his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.--Having
   spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly,
   triumphing over them in it.--He shall see of the travail of his soul,
   and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant
   justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.

   O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.--We are more than
   conquerors through him that loved us.--They overcame by the blood of
   the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony.

   Exo. 15:11. -Isa. 59:16. -I Pet. 2:24. -Gal. 3:13.Psa. 98:1. -Col. 2:l5. -Isa. 53:11.Judg. 5:21. -Rom. 8:37.Rev. 12:11.
     __________________________________________________________________

   AUGUST 3 MORNING

   His mercy is on them that fear Him.--LUKE 1:50.

   Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that
   fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before
   the sons of men! Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence
   from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from
   the strife of tongues.

   If ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth
   according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in
   fear.--The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him in truth. He
   will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their
   cry, and will save them.

   Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before
   the Lord, . . . and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also
   have heard thee, saith the Lord.--To this man will I look, even to him
   that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.--The
   Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as
   be of a contrite spirit.

   Psa. 31:19,20.I Pet. 1:17. -Psa. 145:18,19.II Kgs. 22:19. -Isa. 66:2.
   -Psa. 34:18.
     __________________________________________________________________

   AUGUST 3 EVENING

   Them that honour me I will honour.--I SAM. 2:30.

   Whosoever . . . shall confess me before men, him will I confess also
   before my Father which is in heaven.--He that loveth father or mother
   more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter
   more than me is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his cross, and
   followeth after me, is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life shall
   lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.

   Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he
   shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them
   that love him.

   Fear none of these things which thou shalt suffer. Be thou faithful
   unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.

   Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far
   more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.--Praise and honour and
   glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.

   Matt. 10:32. -Matt. 10:37-39.Jas. 1:12.Rev. 2:10.II Cor. 4:17. -I Pet. 1:7.
     __________________________________________________________________

   AUGUST 4 MORNING

   It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.--JOHN 19:30.

   Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.--I have glorified thee on
   the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.--We are
   sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for
   all. And every priest standeth daily ministering an offering oftentimes
   the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: but this man,
   after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the
   right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made
   his footstool. For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that
   are sanctified.--Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was
   against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way,
   nailing it to his cross.

   I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from
   me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I
   have power to take it again.--Greater love hath no man than this, that
   a man lay down his life for his friends.

   Heb. 12:2. -John 17:4. -Heb. 10:10-14. -Col. 2:14.John 10:17,18. -John. 15:13.
     __________________________________________________________________

   AUGUST 4 EVENING

   He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.--PSA. 18:16.

   He brought me up . . . out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay,
   and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.--You hath he
   quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past ye
   walked according to the course of this world. We all had our
   conversation in times past in the lusts our flesh.

   Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. From the end the earth will
   I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed.--Out of the belly of
   hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice. For thou hadst cast me into
   the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about:
   all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.--We went through fire and
   through water: thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.

   When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through
   the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.

   Psa. 40:2. -Eph. 2:1,3.Psa. 61:1,2. -Jon. 2:2,3. -Psa. 66:12.Isa. 43:2.
     __________________________________________________________________

   AUGUST 5 MORNING

   Walk in newness of life.--ROM. 6:4.

   As ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity
   unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness
   unto holiness.--I beseech you, . . . brethren, by the mercies of God,
   that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
   God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this
   world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.

   If any man be in Christ he is a new creature: old things are passed
   away; behold, all things are become new.--In Christ Jesus neither
   circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
   And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and
   mercy.--This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye
   henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their
   mind.--Ye have not so learned Christ; if so be that ye have heard him,
   and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus. Put on the new
   man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.

   Rom. 6:19. -Rom. 12:1,2.II Cor. 5:17. -Gal. 6:15,16. -Eph. 4:17. -Eph. 4:20,21,24.
     __________________________________________________________________

   AUGUST 5 EVENING

   Thy will be done.--MATT. 26:42.

   O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man
   that walketh to direct his steps.--Not as I will, but as thou
   wilt.--Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is
   weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.

   We know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself
   maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And
   he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit,
   because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of
   God.

   Ye know not what ye ask.--He gave them their request; but sent leanness
   into their soul.--These things were our examples, to the intent we
   should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.

   I would have you without carefulness.--Thou wilt keep him in perfect
   peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.

   Jer. 10:23. -Matt. 26:39. -Psa. 131:2.Rom. 8:26,27.Matt. 20:22. -Psa. 106:15. -I Cor. 10:6.I Cor. 7:32. -Isa. 26:3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   AUGUST 6 MORNING

   Whom the Lord loveth he correcteth.--PROV. 3:12.

   See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and
   I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can
   deliver out of my hand.--I know the thoughts that I think toward you,
   saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an
   expected end.--My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
   my ways, saith the Lord.

   I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak
   comfortably unto her.--As a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God
   chasteneth thee.--Now no chastening for the present, seemeth to be
   joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable
   fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.--Humble
   yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt
   you in due time.

   I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
   faithfulness hast afflicted me.

   Deut. 32:39. -Jer. 29:11. -Isa. 55:8.Hos. 2:14. -Deut. 8:5. -Heb. 12:11. -I Pet. 5:6.Psa. 119:75.
     __________________________________________________________________

   AUGUST 6 EVENING

   The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.--PSA. 24:1.

   She did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and
   multiplied her silver and gold. Therefore will I return, and take away
   my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and I
   will recover my wool and my flax.

   All things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee. For we
   are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our
   days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding. O Lord
   our God, all this store . . . cometh of thine hand, and is all thine
   own.--Of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be
   glory for ever. Amen.

   The living God . . . giveth us richly all things to enjoy.--Every
   creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received
   with thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

   My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by
   Christ Jesus.

   AUGUST 7 MORNING

   The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
   name.--JOHN 14:26.

   If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give
   me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given
   thee living water.--If ye . . . being evil, know how to give good gifts
   unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the
   Holy Spirit to them that ask him?--Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.
   Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive,
   that your joy may be full.--Ye have not, because ye ask not.

   When . . . the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all
   truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear,
   that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall
   glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

   They rebelled, and vexed his Holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be
   their enemy, and He fought against them.

   John 4:10. -Luke 11:13. -John 16:23,24. -Jas. 4:2.John 16:13,14.Isa. 63:10.
     __________________________________________________________________

   AUGUST 7 EVENING

   What think ye of Christ?--MATT. 22:42.

   Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting
   doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory?
   The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.--He hath on his vesture and
   on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

   Unto you . . . which believe he is precious: but unto them which be
   disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made
   the head of the corner.--Christ crucified, unto the Jews a
   stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which
   are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the
   wisdom of God.

   I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of
   Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things,
   and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ.--Lord, thou knowest
   all things: thou knowest that I love thee.

   Psa. 24:9,10. -Rev. 19:16.I Pet. 2:7. -I Cor. 1:23,24.Phi. 3:8. -John 21:17.
     __________________________________________________________________

   AUGUST 8 MORNING

   The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and
   more unto the perfect day.--PROV. 4:18.

   Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but
   I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am
   apprehended of Christ Jesus.--Then shall we know, if we follow on to
   know the Lord.

   Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their
   Father.--We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of
   the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as
   by the Spirit of the Lord.--When that which is perfect is come, then
   that which is in part shall be done away.--For now we see through a
   glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then
   shall I know even as also I am known.--Beloved, now are we the sons of
   God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that,
   when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he
   is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as
   he is pure.

   Phi. 3:12. -Hos. 6:3.Matt. 13:43. -II Cor. 3:18. -I Cor. 13:10,12. -I

     __________________________________________________________________

   AUGUST 8 EVENING

   Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.--ROM. 10:13.

   Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.--Lord, remember me
   when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I
   say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.--What will ye
   that I shall do unto you? They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be
   opened. So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and
   immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

   If ye . . . being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children:
   how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them
   that ask him?--I will put my Spirit within you. Thus saith the Lord
   GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of.

   This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing
   according to his will, he heareth us: and if we know that he hear us,
   whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired
   of him.

   AUGUST 9 MORNING

   Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.--SONG 4:7.

   The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the
   foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and
   bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound
   up, neither mollified with ointment.--We are all as an unclean thing,
   and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.--I know that in me
   (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing.

   Ye are washed, . . . ye are sanctified, . . . ye are justified in the
   name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.--The King's
   daughter is all glorious within.--Perfect through my comeliness, which
   I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.

   Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us.

   These are they which . . . have washed their robes, and made them white
   in the blood of the Lamb.--A glorious church, not having spot, or
   wrinkle, or any such thing; but . . . holy and without blemish.--Ye are
   complete in him.

   AUGUST 9 EVENING

   Broken cisterns, that can hold no water.--JER. 2:13.

   Eve . . . bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord.

   Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto
   heaven. The Lord scattered them.--Lot chose him all the plain of
   Jordan; it was well watered every where, even as the garden of the
   Lord. But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord
   exceedingly.

   I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I
   perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. For in much wisdom is
   much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.--I made
   me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: I gathered
   me also silver and gold. Then I looked on all, and, behold, all was
   vanity and vexation of spirit.

   If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.--He satisfieth the
   longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.

   Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.

   I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but thou
   shouldest keep them from the evil.--JOHN 17:15.

   Blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst
   of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the
   world.--Ye are the salt of the earth, . . . the light of the
   world.--Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
   works, and glorify your Father which is heaven.

   I also withheld thee from sinning against me.

   The Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from
   evil.--So did not I, because of the fear of God.--Who gave himself for
   our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world,
   according to the will of God and our Father.--Now unto him that is able
   to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the
   presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our
   Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.
   Amen.

   AUGUST 10 EVENING

   Whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe. (Or, set on
   high)--PROV. 29:25.

   The Lord is exalted; for he dwelleth on high.--The Lord is high above
   all nations, and his glory above the heavens. He raiseth up the poor
   out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; that he may
   set him with princes.

   God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith He loved us,
   even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ,
   (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together and made us sit
   together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.

   He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how
   shall he not with him also freely give us all things? For I am
   persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
   principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
   height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
   from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

   AUGUST 11 MORNING

   That through death He might destroy him that had the power of
   death.--HEB. 2:14.

   Our Saviour Jesus Christ . . . hath abolished death, and hath brought
   life and immortality to light through the gospel.--He will swallow up
   death in victory; and the Lord GOD shall wipe away the tears from off
   all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all
   the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it.--When this corruptible shall
   have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on
   immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written,
   Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave,
   where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of
   sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory
   through our Lord Jesus Christ.

   God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love,
   and of a sound mind.--Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
   shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and
   thy staff they comfort me.

   Where is the way that light dwelleth?--JOB 38:19.

   God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.--As long as I am in the
   world, I am the light of the world.

   If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we
   lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the light, as he is in the
   light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus
   Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.--The Father . . . hath made
   us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who
   hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us
   into the kingdom of his dear Son; in whom we have redemption through
   his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.

   Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are
   not of the night, nor of darkness.--Ye are the light of the world. A
   city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Let your light so shine
   before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father
   which is in heaven.

   I John 1:5. -John 9:5.I John 1:6,7. -Col 1:12-14.I Thes. 5:5. -Matt. 5:14,16.

   AUGUST 12 MORNING

   The Lord will not cast off for ever: but though he cause grief, yet
   will he have compassion.--LAM. 3:31,32.

   Fear thou not, . . . saith the Lord: for I am with thee; I will not
   make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure.--For a small
   moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.
   In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with
   everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy
   Redeemer. For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but
   my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of
   my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee. O thou
   afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay
   thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.

   I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against
   him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will
   bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.

   Jer. 46:28. -Isa. 54:7,8,10,11.Mic. 7:9.

   AUGUST 12 EVENING

   God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things
   which are mighty.--I COR. 1:27.

   When the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised them
   up a deliverer, Ehud, . . . a man lefthanded. After him was Shamgar, .
   . . which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and
   he also delivered Israel.

   The Lord looked upon [Gideon], and said, Go in this thy might: . . .
   have not I sent thee? And he said unto him, O my Lord, wherewith shall
   I save Israel? behold my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least
   in my father's house.

   The Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many
   for me, . . . lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own
   hand hath saved me.

   Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of
   hosts.--My brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
   might.

   AUGUST 13 MORNING

   He hath prepared for them a city.--HEB. 11:16.

   If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you
   unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.--An inheritance
   incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in
   heaven for you.--Here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to
   come.

   This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come
   in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.--Be patient
   therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.--Behold, the
   husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long
   patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also
   patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the the Lord draweth
   nigh.--Yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will
   not tarry.

   We which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in
   the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with
   the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

   John 14:3. -I Pet. 1:4. -Heb. 13:14.Acts 1:11. -Jas. 5:7,8. -Heb. 10:37.I Thes. 4:17,18.

   Base things of the world hath God chosen.--I COR. 1:28.

   Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers,
   nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves,
   nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall
   inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are
   washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the
   Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

   You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; wherein in
   time past ye walked according to the course of this world; among whom
   also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our
   flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind.

   According to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and
   renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through
   Jesus Christ our Saviour.

   My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith
   the Lord.

   I Cor. 6:9-11.Eph. 2:1-3.Tit. 3:5,6.Isa. 55:8.

   AUGUST 14 MORNING

   The joy of the Lord is your strength.--NEH. 8:10.

   Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth with singing,
   O mountains: for the Lord hath comforted his people and will have mercy
   upon his afflicted.--Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not
   be afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is
   become my salvation.--The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart
   trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;
   and with my song will I praise him.--My soul shall be joyful in my God;
   for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered
   me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with
   ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.

   I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those
   things which pertain to God.--We . . . joy in God through our Lord
   Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.--I will joy
   in the God of my salvation.

   He hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things,
   and sure.--II SAM. 23:5.

   I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he able to keep that
   which I have committed unto him against that day.

   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
   blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places Christ:
   according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the
   world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:
   having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
   to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will.

   We know that all things work together for good to them that love God,
   to them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did
   foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his
   Son. Moreover whom be did predestinate, them he also called: and whom
   he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also
   glorified.

   AUGUST 15 MORNING

   The God of peace make you perfect in every good work to do his
   will.--HEB. 13:20,21.

   Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the
   God of love and peace shall be with you.

   By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is
   the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast.--Every good
   gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the
   Father of lights, with whom is no variableness neither shadow of
   turning.

   Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God
   which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.--Be
   ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is
   that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.--Being filled with
   the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory
   and praise of God.

   Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of

   AUGUST 15 EVENING

   I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak
   comfortably unto her.--HOS. 2:14.

   Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch
   not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father
   unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord
   Almighty.--Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us
   cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
   perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

   Jesus, . . . that he might sanctify the people with his own blood,
   suffered without the gate. Let us go forth therefore unto him without
   the camp, bearing his reproach.

   [Jesus] said, . . . Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and
   rest a while.--The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me
   to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
   He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for
   his name's sake.

   AUGUST 16 MORNING

   The house that is to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding
   magnifical.--I CHR. 22:5.

   Ye . . . as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house.--Know ye not
   that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in
   you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for
   the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.--Your body is the
   temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye
   are not your own. For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God
   in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.--What agreement hath
   the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God;
   as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be
   their God, and they shall be my people.--Ye . . . are built upon the
   foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the
   chief cornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together
   groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded
   together for a habitation of God through the Spirit.

   He is before all things.--COL. 1:17.

   The Amen; the beginning of the creation of God.--The beginning, the
   firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the
   preeminence.

   The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of
   old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the
   earth was. When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a
   compass upon the face of the depth: when he established the clouds
   above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep; when he gave to
   the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment. I
   was daily his delight rejoicing always before him.--Yea, before the day
   was I am he.

   The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.--The author and
   finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him, endured
   the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of
   the throne of God.

   Pray one for another, that ye may be healed.--JAS. 5:16.

   Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak
   unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: peradventure there shall
   lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all city for lack
   of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not
   destroy it.

   Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.--Pray for them
   which despitefully use you, and persecute you.

   I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast
   given me; for they are thine. Neither pray I for these alone, but for
   them also which shall believe on me through their word.--Bear ye one
   another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.

   The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. Elias
   was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly
   that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of
   three years and six months.

   As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he
   flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the
   place thereof shall know it no more.--PSA. 103:15,16.

   So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts to
   wisdom.--What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world,
   and lose his own soul?

   Surely the people is grass. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but
   the word of our God shall stand for ever.--The world passeth away, and
   the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.

   Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of
   salvation.--Use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this
   world passeth away.--Let us consider one another to provoke unto love
   and to good works: not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together,
   as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another; and so much the
   more, as ye see the day approaching.

   AUGUST 18 MORNING

   What God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy
   works, and according to thy might?--DEUT. 3:24.

   Who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord? who among the sons of
   the mighty can be likened unto the Lord? O Lord God of hosts, who is a
   strong Lord like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about
   thee?--Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are
   there any works like unto thy works.--For thy word's sake, and
   according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things, to
   make thy servant know them. Wherefore thou art great, O Lord God: for
   there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee,
   according to all that we have heard with our ears.

   Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart
   of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But
   God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.--The secret things belong
   unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto
   us and to our children.

   He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.--I COR. 1:31.

   Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man
   glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let
   him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me,
   that I am the Lord.

   I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of
   Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things,
   and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ.--I am not ashamed of
   the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to
   every one that believeth.--I have whereof I may glory through Jesus
   Christ in those things which pertain to God.

   Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I
   desire beside thee.--My heart rejoiceth in the Lord. . . . I rejoice in
   thy salvation.

   Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy
   mercy, and for thy truth's sake.

   Ye know how we exhorted . . . and charged every one of you, that ye
   would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and

   of darkness into his marvellous light.

   Ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as
   children of light: (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and
   righteousness and truth;) proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. And
   have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
   reprove them.--Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are

   Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works,
   and glorify your Father which is in heaven.--Whether therefore ye eat,

   AUGUST 19 EVENING

   Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of
   my hands command ye me.--ISA. 45:11.

   A new heart . . . will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within
   you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will
   give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and
   cause you to walk in my statutes. Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet
   for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them.

   If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall
   ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For
   where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the
   midst of them.

   Have faith in God. Verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto
   this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and
   shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which
   he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.

   God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he
   should repent.--NUM. 23:19.

   The Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of
   turning.--Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and for ever.

   His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

   God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the
   immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath; that by two
   immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might
   have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
   the hope set before us.

   The faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love
   him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations.--All the paths
   of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his
   testimonies.--Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help,
   whose hope is in the Lord his God . . . which keepeth truth for ever.

   AUGUST 20 EVENING

   If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.--PROV. 24:10.

   He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he
   increaseth strength.--My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength
   is made perfect in weakness.--He shall call upon me, and I will answer
   him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him.--The eternal
   God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he
   shall thrust out the enemy from before thee.

   I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters,
   but I found none.

   Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things
   pertaining to God, . . . who can have compassion on the ignorant, and
   on them that are out of the way: so also Christ, . . . though he were a
   Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and
   being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all
   them that obey him.--Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our
   sorrows.

   AUGUST 21 MORNING

   Thou art my portion, O Lord.--PSA. 119:57.

   All things are yours; . . . and ye are Christ's; and Christ is
   God's.--Our Saviour Jesus Christ . . . gave himself for us.--God gave
   him to be the head over all things to the church.--Christ loved the
   church, and gave himself for it; that he might present it to himself a
   glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but
   that it should be holy and without blemish.

   My soul shall make her boast in the Lord.--I will greatly rejoice in
   the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me
   with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of
   righteousness.

   Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I
   desire beside thee. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the
   strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.--O my soul, thou hast
   said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord. The Lord is the portion of mine
   inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. The lines are
   fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.

   There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are
   the ways of death.--PROV. 14:12.

   He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool.

   Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.--Concerning
   the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths
   of the destroyer.

   If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, saying, Let
   us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve
   them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet: for the
   Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God
   with all your heart and with all your soul. Ye shall walk after the
   Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his
   voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.

   I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I
   will guide thee with mine eye.

   AUGUST 22 MORNING

   None of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.--ROM. 14:7.

   Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto
   the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.--Let no
   man seek his own: but every man another's wealth.--Ye are bought with a
   price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which
   are God's.

   Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by
   death. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. But if I live
   in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I
   wot not. For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart,
   and to be with Christ; which is far better.

   I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. I am
   crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ
   liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the
   faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.

   AUGUST 22 EVENING

   God gave Solomon . . . largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on
   the sea shore.--I KGS. 4:29.

   Behold, a greater than Solomon is here.--The Prince of Peace.

   Scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good
   man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth his love toward us,
   in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.--Who, being in
   the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made
   himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and
   was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man,
   he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of
   the cross.--The love of Christ passeth knowledge.

   Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.--In whom are hid all
   the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.--The unsearchable riches of
   Christ.--Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
   wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.

   Matt. 12:42. -Isa. 9:6.Rom. 5:7,8. -Phi. 2:6-8. -Eph. 3:19.I Cor. 1:24.

   AUGUST 23 MORNING

   I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with
   lovingkindness have I drawn thee.--JER. 31:3.

   We are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of
   the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation
   through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: whereunto
   he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord
   Jesus Christ.--God . . . hath saved us, and called us with a holy
   calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose
   and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world
   began.--Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in
   thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were
   fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

   God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
   whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life.

   Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent
   his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

   II Thes. 2:13,14. -II Tim. 1:9. -Psa. 139:16.John 3:16.I John 4:10.

   AUGUST 23 EVENING

   I have made, and I will bear.--ISA. 46:4.

   Thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed
   thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee
   by thy name; thou art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I
   will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow
   thee.--Even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I
   carry you.

   As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth
   abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the Lord
   alone did lead him.--He bare them, and carried them all the days of
   old.

   Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever.--For I am
   persuaded, that neither . . . height, nor depth, nor any other
   creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is
   in Christ Jesus our Lord.

   Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
   compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not
   forget thee.

   Isa. 43:1,2. -Isa. 46:4.Deut. 32:11,12. -Isa. 63:9.Heb. 13:8. -Rom. 8:38,39.Isa. 49:15.

   AUGUST 24 MORNING

   I know their sorrows.--EXO. 3:7.

   A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.--Touched with the feeling
   of our infirmities.

   Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.--Jesus being
   wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well.

   When Jesus . . . saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came
   with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled. Jesus wept.--For
   in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour
   them that are tempted.

   He hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did
   the Lord behold the earth; to hear the groaning of the prisoner; to
   loose those that are appointed to death.--He knoweth the way that I
   take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.--When my
   spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path.

   He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.--In all their
   affliction he was afflicted; and the angel of his presence saved them.

   Isa. 53:3. -Heb. 4:15.Matt. 8:17. -John 4:6.John 11:33,35. -Heb. 2:18.Psa. 102:19,20. -Job 23:10. -Psa. 142:3.Zech. 2:8. -Isa. 63:9.

   AUGUST 24 EVENING

   I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day.--JOHN 9:4.

   The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of
   the diligent shall be made fat.--He that watereth shall be watered.

   My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
   Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest: behold,
   I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are
   white already to harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and
   gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that
   reapeth may rejoice together.--The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man
   that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire
   labourers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the labourers
   for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.

   Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season.--Occupy till I
   come.

   I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of
   God which was with me.

   Prov. 13:4. -Prov. 11:25.John 4:34-36. -Matt. 20:1,2.II Tim. 4:2. -Luke 19:13.I Cor. 15:10.
     __________________________________________________________________

   AUGUST 25 MORNING

   Look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit
   whence ye are digged.--ISA 51:1.

   Behold, I was shapen in iniquity.--None eye pitied thee but thou wast
   cast out in the open field, to the loathing of thy person, in the day
   that thou wast born. And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted
   in thine own blood, I said unto thee, Live.

   He brought me up . . . out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and
   set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. And he hath put a
   new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God.

   When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the
   ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet
   peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God
   commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
   Christ died for us.--God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love
   wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened
   us together with Christ.

   Psa. 51:5. -Ezek. 16:5,6.Psa. 40:2,3.Rom. 5:6-8. -Eph. 2:4,5.

   AUGUST 25 EVENING

   I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my
   God.--ISA. 61:10.

   I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in
   my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall
   hear thereof, and be glad. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt
   his name together.--The Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing
   will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. O Lord of hosts,
   blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.--Bless the Lord, O my soul:
   and all that is within me, bless his holy name.

   Is any merry? let him sing psalms.--Be filled with the Spirit; speaking
   to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and
   making melody in your heart to the Lord; giving thanks always for all
   things.--Singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

   At midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the
   prisoners heard them.--Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again, I say,
   Rejoice.

   AUGUST 26 MORNING

   Thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the
   engravings of a signet: HOLINESS TO THE LORD.--EXO. 28:36.

   Holiness, without which no man can see the Lord.--God is a Spirit: and
   they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.--But we
   are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy
   rags.--I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all
   the people I will be glorified.

   This is the law of the house: Upon the top of the mountain the whole
   limit thereof round about shall be most holy.--Holiness becometh thine
   house, O Lord, for ever.

   For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified
   through the truth.--Seeing . . . that we have a great high priest, that
   is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us . . . come
   boldly unto the throne of grace. that we may obtain mercy, and find
   grace to help in time of need.

   AUGUST 26 EVENING

   My cup runneth over.--PSA. 23:5.

   O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth
   in him. O fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them
   that fear him. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they
   that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.--His compassions fail
   not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.

   The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou
   maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places;
   yea, I have a goodly heritage.--Whether . . . the world, or life, or
   death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's.--Blessed
   be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us
   with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.

   I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be
   content.--Godliness with contentment is great gain.--My God shall
   supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

   AUGUST 27 MORNING

   Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.--PSA. 119:105.

   By the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.
   Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.--When thou
   goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and
   when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. For the commandment is a
   lamp; and the law is light.--Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee,
   saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand,
   and when ye turn to the left.

   I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in
   darkness, but shall have the light of life.--We have also a sure ...
   word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a
   light that shineth in a dark place.--Now we see through a glass,
   darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I
   know even as also I am known.--They need no candle, neither light of
   the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for
   ever and ever.

   AUGUST 27 EVENING

   What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise.--JON. 1:6.

   This is not your rest: . . . it is polluted, it shall destroy you.--Set
   your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.--If riches
   increase, set not your heart upon them.--Set your heart and your soul
   to seek your God: arise therefore.

   Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.--Take heed
   to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with
   surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day
   come upon you unawares.

   While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.--Yet a
   little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not
   tarry.--Now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our
   salvation nearer than when we believed.--Watch ye therefore: for ye
   know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight,
   or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: lest coming suddenly he finds
   you sleeping.

   AUGUST 28 MORNING

   The accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our
   God day and night.--REV. 12:10.

   They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their
   testimony.--Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is
   God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died,
   yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God,
   who also maketh intercession for us.

   Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them
   openly.--That through death he might destroy him that had the power of
   death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death
   were all their lifetime subject to bondage.--In all these things we are
   more than conquerors, through him that loved us.--Put on the whole
   armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the
   devil. And take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of
   God.--Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   AUGUST 28 EVENING

   The tree of life.--GEN. 2:9.

   God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.--He
   gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
   perish, but have everlasting life.--As the Father raiseth up the dead,
   and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. As the
   Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life
   in himself.

   To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is
   in the midst of the paradise of God.--In the midst of the street of it,
   and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare
   twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the
   leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.

   Happy is the man that findeth wisdom. Length of days is in her right
   hand. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy
   is every one that retaineth her.--Christ Jesus, . . . is made unto us
   wisdom.

   AUGUST 29 MORNING

   Whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he.--PROV. 16:20.

   [Abraham] staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was
   strong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully persuaded that,
   what he had promised, he was able also to perform.--The children of
   Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the Lord God of their
   fathers.

   God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
   Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the
   mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.--It is better to trust
   in the Lord than to put confidence in man. It is better to trust in the
   Lord than to put confidence in princes.--The steps of a good man are
   ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he
   shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his
   hand.

   O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth
   in him. O fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them
   that fear him.

   AUGUST 29 EVENING

   I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, Lord, only
   makest me dwell in safety.--PSA. 4:8.

   Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night. He shall cover thee
   with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust.--Even as a hen
   gathereth her chickens under her wings.--He will not suffer thy foot to
   be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that
   keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord is thy keeper:
   the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.

   I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the cover of
   thy wings.--The darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as
   the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.

   He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how
   shall he not with him also freely give us all things?--Ye are Christ's;
   and Christ is God's.--I will trust, and not be afraid.

   AUGUST 30 MORNING

   The king held out . . . the golden sceptre. So Esther drew near, and
   touched the top of the sceptre.--ESTH. 5:2.

   It shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I
   am gracious.

   We have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love;
   and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is
   our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of
   judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear
   in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment.
   He that feareth is not made perfect in love. We love him, because he
   first loved us.

   Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having
   our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed
   with pure water.--For through him we . . . have access by one Spirit
   unto the Father.--We have boldness and access with confidence by the
   faith of him.--Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace,
   that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

   AUGUST 30 EVENING

   They said, . . . it is manna: for they wist not what it was.--EXO. 16:15.

   Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest
   in the flesh.--The bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven,
   and giveth life unto the world.

   Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. If any man
   eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will
   give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. My flesh
   is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.

   The children of Israel . . . gathered, some more, some less. He that
   gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no
   lack. They gathered it every morning, every man according to his
   eating.

   Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat: or, What shall we drink?
   Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But
   seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness; and all these
   things shall be added unto you.

     __________________________________________________________________

   AUGUST 31 MORNING

   The free gift is of many offences unto justification.--ROM. 5:16.

   Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though
   they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.--I, even I, am he that
   blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not
   remember thy sins. Put me in remembrance: let us plead together:
   declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.--I have blotted out, as a
   thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto
   me; for I have redeemed thee.

   God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
   whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life.--Not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the
   offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift
   by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto
   many.--And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
   sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by
   the Spirit of our God.

   Occupy till I come.--LUKE 19:13.

   The Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house,
   and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and
   commanded the porter to watch.--Unto one he gave five talents, to
   another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several
   ability; and straightway took his journey.

   I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night
   cometh, when no man can work.--Wist ye not that I must be about my
   Father's business?--Leaving us an example, that ye should follow his
   steps.

   Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke,
   exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.--Every man's work shall be
   made manifest: for the day shall declare it.--Therefore, my beloved
   brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of
   the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the
   Lord.

   SEPTEMBER 1 MORNING

   The fruit of the spirit is meekness.--GAL. 5:22,23.

   The meek . . . shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor among
   men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.--Except ye be converted,
   and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of
   heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
   the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.--The ornament of a meek
   and quiet spirit, . . . is in the sight of God of great price.--Charity
   vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.

   Follow after meekness.--Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am
   meek and lowly in heart.--He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet
   he opened not his mouth: he is brought as lamb to the slaughter, and as
   a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his
   mouth.--Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye
   should follow his steps: who did no sin neither was guile found in his
   mouth: who, when he was reviled reviled not again, . . . but committed
   himself to him that judgeth righteously.

   SEPTEMBER 1 EVENING

   If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
   cross daily, and follow me.--LUKE 9:23.

   By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report.--All that will
   live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.--The offence of
   the cross.

   If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

   If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye: but let none
   of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a
   busybody in other men's matters. Yet if any man suffer as a Christian,
   let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.

   Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on
   him, but also to suffer for his sake.--If one died for all, then were
   all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not
   henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and
   rose again.--If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.

   II Cor. 6:8. -II Tim. 3:12. -Gal. 5:11.Gal. 1:10.I Pet. 4:14-16.Phi. 1:29-II Cor. 5:14,15. -II Tim. 2:12.

   SEPTEMBER 2 MORNING

   Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine
   heart.--PSA. 27:14.

   Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the
   Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is
   weary? He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he
   increaseth strength.--Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not
   dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help
   thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my
   righteousness.--Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to
   the needy in distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat,
   when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.

   The trying of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have her
   perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.--Cast
   not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of
   reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will
   of God, ye might receive the promise.

   Isa. 40:28,29. -Isa. 41:10. -Isa. 25:4.Jas. 1:3,4. -Heb. 10:35,36.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 2 EVENING

   He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.--PSA. 23:2.

   The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest. There is no
   peace, saith my God, to the wicked.

   Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
   you rest.--Rest in the Lord.--He that is entered into his rest, he also
   hath ceased from his own works.

   Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a
   good thing that the heart be established with grace.--That . . . we be
   no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind
   of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby
   they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow
   up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.

   I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet
   to my taste. He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over
   me was love.

   Isa. 57:20,21.Matt. 11:28. -Psa.37:7. -Heb. 4:10.Heb. 13:9. -Eph. 4:14,15.Song 2:3,4.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 3 MORNING

   Neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.--EXO. 13:7.

   The fear of the Lord is to hate evil.--Abhor that which is
   evil.--Abstain from all appearance of evil.--Looking diligently lest
   any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing
   up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.

   If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.

   Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? Purge out
   therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are
   unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:
   therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the
   leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of
   sincerity and truth.--Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of
   that bread, and drink of that cup.

   Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from
   iniquity.--Such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless,
   undefiled, separate from sinners.--In him is no sin.

   Prov. 8:13. -Rom. 12:9. -I Thes. 5:22. -Heb. 12:15.Psa. 66:18.I Cor. 5:6-8. -I Cor. 11:28.II Tim. 2:19. -Heb. 7:26. -I John 3:5.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 3 EVENING

   The serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: . . . your
   eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and
   evil.--GEN. 3:4,5.

   I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
   subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is
   in Christ.

   My brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put
   on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the
   wiles of the devil. Take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may
   be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
   Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on
   the breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the
   preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of
   faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the
   wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
   which is the word of God.--Lest Satan should get an advantage of us;
   for we are not ignorant of his devices.

   II Cor. 11:3.Eph. 6:10,11,13-17. -II Cor. 2:11.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 4 MORNING

   Sit still, my daughter.--RUTH 3:18.

   Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted.--Be still,
   and know that I am God.--Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest
   believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?--The loftiness of man
   shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and
   the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.

   Mary . . . sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.--Mary hath chosen
   that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.--In returning
   and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be
   your strength.--Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be
   still.

   Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because
   of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth
   wicked devices to pass.

   He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in
   the Lord. His heart is established.

   He that believeth shall not make haste.

   Isa. 7:4. -Psa. 46:10. -John 11:40. -Isa. 2:17.Luke 10:39. -Luke 10:42.

     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 4 EVENING

   What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.--JOHN 13:7.

   Thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these
   forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to
   know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his
   commandments, or no.

   When I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the
   time of love; yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with
   thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine.--Whom the Lord loveth
   he chasteneth.

   Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to
   try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice,
   inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his
   glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.--Our
   light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
   exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things
   which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.

   Deut. 8:2.Ezek. 16:8. -Heb. 12:6.I Pet. 4:12,13. -II Cor. 4:17,18.

   SEPTEMBER 5 MORNING

   As the body is one, and hath many members, . . . so also is Christ.--I COR. 12:12.

   He is the head of the body, the church.--The head over things to the
   church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in
   all.--We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.

   A body hast thou prepared me.--Thine eyes did see my substance, yet
   being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in
   continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

   Thine they were, and thou gavest them me.--He hath chosen us in him
   before the foundation of the world.--Whom he did foreknow, he also did
   predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son.

   Grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: from
   whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which
   every joint supplieth . . . maketh increase of the body unto the
   edifying of itself in love.

   Col. 1:18. -Eph. 1:22,23. -Eph. 5:30.Heb. 10:5. -Psa. 139:16.John 17:6.

   SEPTEMBER 5 EVENING

   The fountain of living waters.--JER. 2:13.

   How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of
   men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. They shall be
   abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house and thou shalt make
   them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain
   of life.

   Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be
   hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be
   thirsty.--Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall
   never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be him a well
   of water springing up into everlasting life.--This spake he of the
   Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.

   Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.--The Spirit and
   the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him
   that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of
   life freely.

   Psa. 36:7-9.Isa. 65:13. -John 4:14. -John 7:39.Isa. 55:1. -Rev. 22:17.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 6 MORNING

   Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.--LAM. 3:41.

   Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high, who humbleth
   himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the
   earth!--Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.--I stretch forth my
   hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Hide
   not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the
   pit. Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do
   I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up
   my soul unto thee.

   Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise
   thee. Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in
   thy name.--Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I
   lift up my soul. For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and
   plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.

   Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do.

   Psa. 113:5,6. -Psa. 25:1. -Psa. 143:6-8.Psa. 63:3,4. -Psa. 86:4.5.John 14:13.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 6 EVENING

   Watchman, what of the night?--ISA. 21:11.

   It is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer
   than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let
   us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the
   armour of light.

   Learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and
   putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: so likewise ye, when
   ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.
   Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

   I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My
   soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I
   say, more than they that watch for the morning.

   He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen.
   Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

   Watch, . . . for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son
   of man cometh.

   Rom. 13:11,12.Matt. 24:32,33,35.Psa. 130:5,6.Rev. 22:20.Matt. 25:13.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 7 MORNING

   Rejoicing in hope.--ROM. 12:12.

   The hope which is laid up for you in heaven.--If in this life only we
   have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.--We must through
   much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.--Whosoever doth not
   bear his cross, and come after me cannot be my disciple.--No man should
   be moved by these afflictions, for yourselves know that we are
   appointed thereunto.

   Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.--The God of hope
   fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in
   hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.--Blessed be the God and
   Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy
   hath begotten us again unto lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus
   Christ from the dead.--Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom though
   now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and
   full of glory.--By whom also we have access by faith into this grace
   wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

   Col. 1:5. -I Cor. 15:19. -Acts. 14:22. -Luke 14:27. -I Thes. 3:3.Phi. 4:4. -Rom. 15:13. -I Pet. 1:3. -I Pet. 1:8. -Rom. 5:2.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 7 EVENING

   I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me.--PSA. 40:17.

   I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts
   of peace, and not of evil.--My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither
   are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher
   than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts
   than your thoughts.

   How precious . . . are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the
   sum of them! If I should count them, they are more in number than the
   sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.--Lord, how great are thy
   works! and thy thoughts are very deep.--Many, O Lord my God, are thy
   wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to
   us-ward.

   Not many mighty, not many noble, are called.--Hath not God chosen the
   poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom?--Having
   nothing, and yet possessing all things.--The unsearchable riches of
   Christ.

   Jer. 29:11. -Isa. 55:8,9.Psa. 139:17,18. -Psa. 92:5. -Psa. 40:5.I Cor. 1:26. -Jas. 2:5. -II Cor. 6:10. -Eph. 3:8.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 8 MORNING

   Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.--DAN. 5:27.

   The Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him, actions are weighed.--That
   which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of
   God.--The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward
   appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.--Be not deceived, God is
   not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For
   he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he
   that soweth to the Spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting.

   What is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his
   own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?--What
   things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.

   Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts.--Thou hast proved mine
   heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt
   find nothing.

   I Sam. 2:3. -Luke 16:15. -I Sam. 16:7. -Gal. 6:7,8.Matt. 16:26. -Phi. 3:7.Psa. 51:6. -Psa. 17:3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 8 EVENING

   Christ the firstfruits.--I COR. 15:23.

   Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone:
   but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.--If the firstfruit be holy
   the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the
   branches.--Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
   firstfruits of them that slept.--If we have been planted together in
   the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his
   resurrection.--The Lord Jesus Christ . . . shall change our vile body,
   that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the
   working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.

   The firstborn from the dead.--If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus
   from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead
   shall also quicken our mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in
   you.

   I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he
   were dead, yet shall he live.

   John 12:24. -Rom. 11:16. -I Cor. 15:20. -Rom. 6:5. -Phi. 3:20,21.Col. 1:18. -Rom. 8:11.John 11:25.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 9 MORNING

   He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent
   empty away.--LUKE 1:53.

   Thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods and have need of
   nothing: and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and
   poor, and blind, and naked. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
   the fire, that thou mayest be rich. As many as I love, I rebuke and
   chasten: be zealous therefore and repent.

   Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for
   they shall be filled.--When the poor and needy seek water, and there is
   none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I
   the God of Israel will not forsake them.--I am the Lord thy God . . .
   open thy mouth wide and I will fill it.

   Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your
   labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and
   eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in
   fatness.--I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never
   hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.

   SEPTEMBER 9 EVENING

   My feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.--PSA. 73:2.

   When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.

   The Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you,
   that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy
   faith fail not.

   A just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again.--Although he fall,
   he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his
   hand.

   Rejoice not against me, O my enemy: when I fall, I shall arise: when I
   sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me.--He shall deliver
   thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.

   If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
   righteous.--Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost
   that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession
   for them.

   SEPTEMBER 10 MORNING

   I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me forever,
   for the good of them, and of their children after them.--JER. 32:39.

   A new heart . . . will I give you and a new spirit will I put within
   you.--Good and upright is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in
   the way. The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach
   his way. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as
   keep his covenant and his testimonies.

   That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee,
   that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou
   hast sent me.

   I . . . beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye
   are called, with all lowliness and meekness, . . . endeavouring to keep
   the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and
   one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one
   Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above
   all, and through all, and in you all.

   SEPTEMBER 10 EVENING

   They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. (Or, change
   strength.)--ISA. 40:31.

   When I am weak, then am I strong.--God shall be my strength.--He said
   unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made
   perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my
   infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.--Let him take
   hold of my strength.

   Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee.--The arms of
   his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.

   I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

   Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield:
   but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the
   armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.--Plead my cause, O Lord, with
   them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.
   Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

   II Cor. 12:10. -Isa. 49:5. -II Cor. 12:9. -Isa. 27:5.Psa. 55:22. -Gen. 49:24.Gen. 32:26.I Sam. 17:45. -Psa. 35:1,2.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 11 MORNING

   Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing
   of your mind.--ROM. 12:2.

   Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.

   Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?
   whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

   What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what
   communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with
   Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? And what
   agreement hath the temple of God with idols?--Love not the world,
   neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world,
   the love of the Father is not in him. The world passeth away, and the
   lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.

   In time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according
   to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in
   the children of disobedience.--Ye have not so learned Christ; if so be
   that ye have heard him, . . . as the truth is in Jesus.

   SEPTEMBER 11 EVENING

   Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
   evening.--PSA. 104:23.

   In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto
   the ground.--We commanded you, that if any would not work, neither
   should he eat.--Study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to
   work with your own hands.

   Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is
   no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither
   thou goest.--The night cometh when no man can work.

   Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if
   we faint not.--Always abounding in the work of the Lord forasmuch as ye
   know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

   There remaineth . . . a rest to the people of God.--Unto us, which have
   borne the burden and heat of the day.--This is the rest wherewith ye
   may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing.

   SEPTEMBER 12 MORNING

   I have seen his ways, and will heal him.--ISA. 57:18.

   I am the Lord that healeth thee.

   O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my
   downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
   Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all
   my ways.--Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in
   the light of thy countenance.--All things are naked and opened unto the
   eyes of him with whom we have to do.

   Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins
   be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
   crimson, they shall be as wool.--He is gracious unto him, and saith,
   Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.--He was
   wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the
   chastisement of our peace was upon him: and with his stripes we are
   healed.--He hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted.--Thy faith hath
   made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.

   SEPTEMBER 12 EVENING

   The Lord taketh my part.--PSA. 118:7.

   The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob
   defend thee; send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out
   of Zion. We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God
   we will set up our banners. Some trust in chariots, and some in horses:
   but we will remember the name of the Lord our God. They are brought
   down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.

   When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall
   lift up a standard against him.--There hath no temptation taken you but
   such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you
   to be tempted above that ye are able: but will with the temptation also
   make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.

   If God be for us, who can be against us?--The Lord is on my side; I
   will not fear.

   Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us, and he will deliver us.

   SEPTEMBER 13 MORNING

   If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.--JOHN 7:37.

   My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my
   heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.--O God, thou art my
   God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh
   longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is; to see
   thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.

   Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath
   no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without
   money and without price.--The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let
   him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And
   whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.--Whosoever
   drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the
   water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing
   up into everlasting life.--My blood is drink indeed.

   Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.

   SEPTEMBER 13 EVENING

   Ye are the salt of the earth.--MATT. 5:13.

   That which is not corruptible.--Being born again, not of corruptible
   seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and
   abideth for ever.--He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet
   shall he live.--The children of God, being the children of the
   resurrection.--The uncorruptible God.

   If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if
   Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is
   life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of him that raised up
   Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the
   dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth
   in you.--It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.

   Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.--Let no
   corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good
   to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.

   SEPTEMBER 14 MORNING

   I, even I, am he that comforteth you.--ISA. 51:12.

   Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of
   mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our
   tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any
   trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of
   God.--Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them
   that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are
   dust.--As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort
   you.--Casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.

   Thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
   longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.

   Another Comforter . . . even the Spirit of truth.--The Spirit . . .
   helpeth our infirmities.

   God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no
   more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more
   pain: for the former things are passed away.

   SEPTEMBER 14 EVENING

   Ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son.--I COR. 1:9.

   He received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such
   a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in
   whom I am well pleased.--Behold, what manner of love the Father hath
   bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.

   Be ye . . . followers of God, as dear children.--If children, then
   heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.

   The brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person.--Let
   your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
   glorify your Father which is in heaven.

   Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was
   set before him endured the cross, despising the shame.--These things I
   speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in
   themselves.--As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our
   consolation also aboundeth by Christ.

   SEPTEMBER 15 MORNING

   Sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but
   under grace.--ROM. 6:14.

   What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under
   grace? God forbid.--My brethren, ye . . . are become dead to the law by
   the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him
   who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto
   God.--Being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ.--The
   sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks
   be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

   The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from
   the law of sin and death.--Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of
   sin.--If the Son . . . shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.

   Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free,
   and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

   SEPTEMBER 15 EVENING

   A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.--JAS. 1:8.

   No man, having put his hand to the plough and looking back, is fit for
   the kingdom of God.

   He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
   rewarder of them that diligently seek him.--Let him ask in faith,
   nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven
   with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall
   receive anything of the Lord.--What things soever ye desire, when ye
   pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

   Be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every
   wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness,
   whereby they lie in wait to deceive: but speaking the truth in love, .
   . . grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ.

   Abide in me.--Be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work
   of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in
   the Lord.

   Luke 9:62.Heb. 11:6. -Jas. 1:6,7. -Mark 11:24.Eph. 4:14,15.John 15:4.

   SEPTEMBER 16 MORNING

   The Lord pondereth the hearts.--PROV. 21:2.

   The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly
   shall perish.--The Lord will shew who are his, and who is holy.--Thy
   Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.

   Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and
   see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way
   everlasting.--There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out
   fear.

   Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from
   thee.--When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my
   path.--He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
   Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the
   will of God.

   The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth
   them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ
   depart from iniquity.

   SEPTEMBER 16 EVENING

   Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.--PSA. 30:5.

   No man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that
   we are appointed thereunto. For verily, when we were with you, we told
   you before that we should suffer tribulation.--In me ye . . . have
   peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I
   have overcome the world.

   I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.--The night is
   far spent, the day is at hand.--He shall be as the light of the
   morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the
   tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.

   He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away
   tears from off all faces.--There shall be no more death, neither
   sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the
   former things are passed away.--We which are alive and remain shall be
   caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the
   air. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

   SEPTEMBER 17 MORNING

   A bruised reed shall he not break.--MATT. 12:20.

   The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite
   heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.--He healeth the broken in heart,
   and bindeth up their wounds.--Thus saith the high and lofty One that
   inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy
   place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive
   the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
   For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for
   the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.

   I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven
   away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that
   which was sick.--Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the
   feeble knees; and make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is
   lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.--Behold,
   your God . . . will come and save you.

   SEPTEMBER 17 EVENING

   O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth
   in him.--PSA. 34:8.

   When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine,
   and knew not whence it was: he saith, . . . Every man at the beginning
   doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which
   is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.

   The ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. --I believed, and
   therefore have I spoken.--I know whom I have believed.--I sat down
   under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my
   taste.

   The goodness of God.--He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him
   up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all
   things?

   As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow
   thereby: if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

   Let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout
   for joy.

     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 18 MORNING

   Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy
   law.--PSA. 119:18.

   Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the
   scriptures.--It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom
   of heaven, but to them it is not given.--I thank thee, O Father, Lord
   of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise
   and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father: for so
   it seemed good in thy sight.--We have received, not the spirit of the
   world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things
   that are freely given to us of God.--How precious also are thy thoughts
   unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! If I should count them,
   they are more in number than the sand.--O the depth of the riches both
   of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments,
   and his ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord?
   or who hath been his counsellor? For of him, and through him, and to
   him are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.

   Luke 24:45. -Matt. 13:11. -Matt. 11:25,26. -I Cor. 2:12. -Psa. 139:17,18. -Rom. 11:33,34,36.

   SEPTEMBER 18 EVENING

   En-hakkore. (Or, The well of him that cried.)--JUDG. 15:19.

   If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith unto thee,
   Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have
   given thee living water.--If any man thirst, let him come unto me and
   drink. This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him
   should receive.

   Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you
   the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall
   not be room enough to receive it.--If ye, . . . being evil, know how to
   give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly
   Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?--Ask, and it shall be
   given you; seek, and ye shall find.

   Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into
   your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.--Ye have not received the spirit of
   bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption,
   whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

   SEPTEMBER 19 MORNING

   The God of all grace.--I PET. 5:10.

   I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee; and will be gracious
   to whom I will be gracious.--He is gracious unto him, and saith,
   Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.--Being
   justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ
   Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
   his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that
   are past, through the forbearance of God.--Grace and truth came by
   Jesus Christ.

   By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is
   the gift of God.--Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and
   Jesus Christ our Lord.--Unto every one of us is given grace according
   to the measure of the gift of Christ.--As every man hath received the
   gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the
   manifold grace of God.--He giveth more grace.

   Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever.

   SEPTEMBER 19 EVENING

   I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My
   help cometh from the Lord.--PSA. 121:1,2.

   As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about
   his people from henceforth even for ever.

   Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
   Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters,
   and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes
   wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us.--Because
   thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I
   rejoice.

   O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this
   great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but
   our eyes are upon thee.--Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord; for he
   shall pluck my feet out of the net.--Our help is in the name of the
   Lord, who made heaven and earth.

   SEPTEMBER 20 MORNING

   Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
   understanding.--PROV. 3:13.

   Whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the Lord.

   Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither
   let the mighty man glory in his might: . . . but let him that glorieth
   glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the
   Lord.--The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

   What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea
   doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the
   knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of
   all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ.--In whom
   are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.--Counsel is mine,
   and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.

   Christ Jesus, . . . is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
   sanctification, and redemption.

   He that winneth souls is wise.

   SEPTEMBER 20 EVENING

   Poor, yet making many rich.--II COR. 6:10.

   Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich,
   yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be
   rich.--Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.--My
   God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by
   Christ Jesus.--God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that
   ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every
   good work.

   Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of
   the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?--Not many
   wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:
   but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the
   wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the
   things which are mighty.

   We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the
   power may be of God, and not of us.

   II Cor. 8:9. -John 1:16. -Phi. 4:19. -II Cor. 9:8.Jas. 2:5. -I Cor. 1:26,27.II Cor. 4:7.

   SEPTEMBER 21 MORNING

   We know that all things work together for good to them that love
   God.--ROM. 8:28.

   Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt
   thou restrain.--Ye thought evil against me: but God meant it unto good.

   All things are yours; whether . . . the world, or life, or death, or
   things present, or things to come; all are yours; and ye are Christ's;
   and Christ is God's.--All things are for your sakes, that the abundant
   grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of
   God. For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish,
   yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction,
   which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and
   eternal weight of glory.

   My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
   knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. But let
   patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,
   wanting nothing.

   SEPTEMBER 21 EVENING

   The communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all.--II COR. 13:14.

   I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that
   he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the
   world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him:
   but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.--He
   shall not speak of himself. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive
   of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

   The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
   given unto us.

   He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.--Know ye not that your
   body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of
   God, and ye are not your own?

   Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day
   of redemption.--The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know
   not what we would pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
   intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

   SEPTEMBER 22 MORNING

   My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the Lord.--PSA. 104:34.

   As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among
   the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit
   was sweet to my taste.--For who in the heaven can be compared unto the
   Lord? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord?

   My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.--One
   pearl of great price.--The prince of the kings of the earth.

   His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a
   raven.--The head over all things.--He is the head of the body, the
   church.

   His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers.--He could not be
   hid.

   His lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.--Never man spake
   like this man.

   His countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.--Make thy face
   to shine upon thy servant.--Lord, lift thou up the light thy
   countenance upon us.

   Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from
   this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.

   I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him
   that sent me.--He . . . became obedient unto death, even the death of
   the cross.--In the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers
   and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able
   to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; though he were
   a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.

   Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall
   presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?--Thus it is
   written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the
   dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be
   preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

   John 12:27.John 6:38. -Phi. 2:8. -Heb. 5:7,8.Matt. 26:53. -Luke 24:46,47.

   SEPTEMBER 23 MORNING

   Our God hath not forsaken us.--EZRA 9:9.

   Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to
   try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you.--If ye endure
   chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom
   the father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof
   all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.

   The Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your
   God with all your heart and with all your soul.

   The Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because
   it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people.--Can a woman forget
   her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of
   her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.--Happy is
   he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord
   his God.

   Shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him,
   though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them
   speedily.

   I Pet. 4:12. -Heb. 12:7,8.Deut. 13:3.I Sam. 12:22. -Isa. 49:15. -Psa. 146:5.Luke 18:7,8.

   SEPTEMBER 23 EVENING

   He that overcometh shall inherit all things.--REV. 21:7.

   If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
   miserable.--Now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly:
   wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath
   prepared for them a city.--An inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled,
   and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you.

   All things are yours; . . . the world, or life, or death, or things
   present, or things to come; all are yours.--Eye hath not seen, nor ear
   heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God
   hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto
   us by his Spirit.

   Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have
   wrought, but that we receive a full reward.--Let us lay aside every
   weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with
   patience the race that is set before us.

   I Cor. 15:19. -Heb. 11:16. -I Pet. 1:4.I Cor. 3:21,22. -I Cor. 2:9,10.II John 8. -Heb. 12:1.

   SEPTEMBER 24 MORNING

   It is good for me to draw near to God.--PSA. 73:28.

   Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where
   thine honour dwelleth.--A day in thy courts is better than a thousand.
   I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in
   the tents of wickedness.--Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and
   causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we
   shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy
   temple.

   The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh
   him.--Therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious unto you,
   and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you: for
   the Lord is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.

   Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the
   blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for
   us: . . . let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of
   faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.

   Psa. 26:8. -Psa. 84:10. -Psa. 65:4.Lam. 3:25. -Isa. 30:18.Heb. 10:19,20,22.

   SEPTEMBER 24 EVENING

   Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.--II COR. 8:9.

   The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory,
   the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and
   truth.--Thou are fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into
   thy lips.--All bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words
   which proceeded out of his mouth.

   Ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.--He that believeth on the Son
   of God hath the witness in himself.--We speak that we do know, and
   testify that we have seen.

   O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth
   in him.--I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit
   was sweet to my taste.

   He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is
   made perfect in weakness.--Unto every one of us is given grace
   according to the measure of the gift of Christ.--As every man hath
   received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good
   stewards of the manifold grace of God.

   John 1:14. -Psa. 45:2. -Luke 4:22.I Pet. 2:3. -I John 5:10. -John 3:11.Psa. 34:8. -Song 2:3.II Cor. 12:9. -Eph. 4:7. -I Pet. 4:10.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 25 MORNING

   Let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,
   wanting nothing.--JAS. 1:4.

   Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold
   temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much more precious
   than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be
   found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus
   Christ.--We glory in tribulations: . . . knowing that tribulation
   worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope.

   It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the
   salvation of the Lord.--Ye have in heaven a better and an enduring
   substance. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great
   recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have
   done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.--Our Lord Jesus
   Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath
   given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, comfort
   your hearts.

   I Pet. 1:6,7. -Rom. 5:3,4.Lam. 3:26. -Heb. 10:34-36. -II Thes. 2:16,17.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 25 EVENING

   God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.--ROM. 2:16.

   Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring
   to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the
   counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of
   God.--The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto
   the Son: because he is the Son of man.--The Son of God . . . hath his
   eyes like unto a flame of fire.

   They say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most
   High?--These things thou hast done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest
   that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee,
   and set them in order before thine eyes.--There is nothing covered,
   that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.

   Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from
   thee.--Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.

   I Cor. 4:5. -John 5:22,27. -Rev. 2:18.Psa. 73:11. -Psa. 50:21. -Luke 12:2.Psa. 38:9. -Psa. 26:2.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 26 MORNING

   A God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.--DEUT. 32:4.

   Him that judgeth righteously.--We must all appear before the judgment
   seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body,
   according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.--Every one
   of us shall give account of himself to God.--The soul that sinneth it
   shall die.

   Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my
   fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd.--The Lord hath
   laid on him the iniquity of us all.--Mercy and truth are met together:
   righteousness and peace have kissed each other.--Mercy rejoiceth
   against judgment.--The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is
   eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

   A just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.--Just, and the
   justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.--Justified freely by his
   grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.

   I Pet. 2:23. -II Cor. 5:10. -Rom. 14:12. -Ezek. 18:4.Zech. 13:7.Isa. 53:6. -Psa. 85:10. -Jas. 2:13. -Rom. 6:23.Isa. 45:21. -Rom. 3:26. -Rom. 3:24.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 26 EVENING

   Death is swallowed up in victory.--I COR. 15:54.

   Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   Forasmuch . . . as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he
   also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he
   might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and
   deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject
   to bondage.

   If we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:
   knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death
   hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin
   once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.

   Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but
   alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

   In all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved
   us.

   I Cor. 15:57.Heb. 2:14,15.Rom. 6:8-10. -Rom. 6:11.Rom. 8:37.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 27 MORNING

   Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you
   in due time.--I PET. 5:6.

   Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord: though
   hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.

   O Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and
   we all are the work of thy hand. Be not wroth very sore, O Lord,
   neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see we beseech thee, we are
   all thy people.--Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a
   bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned;
   for thou art the Lord my God. Surely after that I was turned, I
   repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was
   ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my
   youth.--It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.

   Affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring
   out of the ground; yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly
   upward.

   Prov. 16:5.Isa. 64:8,9. -Jer. 31:18,19. -Lam. 3:27.Job 5:6,7.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 27 EVENING

   Yea, hath God said?--GEN. 3:1.

   When the tempter came to Jesus, he said, If thou be the Son of
   God.--Jesus said unto him, It is written, . . . it is written, . . . it
   is written.--Then the devil leaveth him.

   I may not return with thee. For it was said to me by the word of the
   Lord, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there. He said unto him,
   I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word
   of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he
   may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him. So he went back
   with him. The man of God . . . was disobedient unto the word of the
   Lord: therefore the Lord hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath
   torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the Lord.--Though we,
   or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that
   which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.--Thy word have I
   hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.

   Matt. 4:3. -Matt. 4:4,7,10. -Matt. 4:11.I Kgs. 13:16-19,26. -Gal. 1:8.

     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 28 MORNING

   They shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless
   them.--NUM. 6:27.

   O Lord our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but
   by thee only will we make mention of thy name.--We are thine: thou
   never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.

   All people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of
   the Lord; and they shall be afraid of thee.--The Lord will not forsake
   his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the Lord
   to make you his people.

   O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for
   thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy
   name.--Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and
   deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake. Wherefore
   should the heathen say, Where is their God?--The name of the Lord is a
   strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.

   Isa. 26:13. -Isa. 63:19.Deut. 28:10. -I Sam. 12:22.Dan. 9:19. -Psa. 79:9,10. -Prov. 18:10.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 28 EVENING

   The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his
   handywork.--PSA. 19:1.

   The invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly
   seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal
   power and Godhead.--He left not himself without witness.--Day unto day
   uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no
   speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.

   When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the
   stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of
   him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?

   There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and
   another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in
   glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead.--They that be wise
   shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many
   to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.

   Rom. 1:20. -Acts. 14:17. -Psa. 19:2,3.Psa. 8:3,4.I Cor. 15:41,42. -Dan. 12:3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 29 MORNING

   Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for
   us.--I JOHN 3:16.

   The love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.--Greater love hath no man
   than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Ye know the
   grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your
   sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be
   rich.--Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one
   another.--Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
   another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.--Forbearing
   one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel
   against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.--For even the
   Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give
   his life a ransom for many.--Christ . . . suffered for us, leaving us
   an example, that ye should follow his steps.

   Ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an
   example, that ye should do as I have done to you.--We ought to lay down
   our lives for the brethren.

   Eph. 3:19. -John 15:13. -II Cor. 8:9. -I John 4:11. -Eph. 4:32. -Col. 3:13. -Mark 10:45. -I Pet. 2:21.John 13:14,15. -I John 3:16.
     __________________________________________________________________

   SEPTEMBER 29 EVENING

   What things soever the Father doeth, these also doeth the Son
   likewise.--JOHN 5:19.

   The Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and
   understanding.--I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your
   adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.

   Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine
   heart.--My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made
   perfect in weakness.

   Them that are sanctified by God the Father.--He that sanctifieth and
   they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not
   ashamed to call them brethren.

   Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord.--The fulness of him
   that filleth all in all.

   I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.--This is
   indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.

   Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
   our Saviour.

   SEPTEMBER 30 MORNING

   He knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come
   forth as gold.--JOB 23:10.

   He knoweth our frame.--He doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the
   children of men.

   The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth
   them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ
   depart from iniquity. But in a great house there are not only vessels
   of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to
   honour, and some to dishonour. If a man therefore purge himself from
   these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the
   master's use, and prepared unto every good work.

   He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify
   the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may
   offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.--I . . . will refine
   them as silver is refined, . . . they shall call on my name, and I will
   hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, the Lord is
   my God.

   SEPTEMBER 30 EVENING

   Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths.--PSA. 25:4.

   Moses said unto the Lord, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy
   sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee. And he said, My
   presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.--He made known
   his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.

   The meek will he guide in judgment; and the meek will he teach his way.
   What man is he that feareth the Lord? him shall teach in the way that
   he shall choose.--Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not
   unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he
   shall direct thy paths.

   Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy;
   at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.--I will instruct
   thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee
   with mine eye.--The path of the just is as the shining light, that
   shineth more and more unto the perfect day.

   OCTOBER 1 MORNING

   The fruit of the Spirit is temperance.--GAL. 5:22.

   Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now
   they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I
   therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that
   beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into
   subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I
   myself should be a castaway.

   Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess: but be filled with the
   Spirit.

   If any man will come after me let him deny himself, and take up his
   cross, and follow me.

   Let us not sleep, as do others: but let us watch and be sober. For they
   that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in
   the night. But let us, who are of the day, be sober.--Denying
   ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
   godly, in this present world: looking for that blessed hope, and the
   glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.

   I Cor. 9:25-27.Eph. 5:18.Matt. 16:24.I Thes. 5:6-8. -Tit. 2:12,13,.

   OCTOBER 1 EVENING

   Grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.--EPH. 4:15.

   First the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the
   ear.--Till we all come to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge
   of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature
   of the fulness of Christ.

   They measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among
   themselves, are not wise. But he that glorieth, let him glory in the
   Lord. For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord
   commendeth.

   The body is of Christ. Let no man beguile you of your reward in a
   voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those
   things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
   and not holding the Head from which all the body by joints and bands,
   having nourishment ministered and knit together, increaseth with the
   increase of God.

   Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ.

   OCTOBER 2 MORNING

   The goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not
   inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.--LEV. 16:22.

   As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
   transgressions from us.--In those days, and in that time, saith the
   Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be
   none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will
   pardon them whom I reserve.--Thou wilt cast all their sins into the
   depths of the sea.--Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth
   iniquity?

   All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own
   way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.--He shall
   bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the
   great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he hath
   poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the
   transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for
   the transgressors.--The Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
   world.

   OCTOBER 2 EVENING

   Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou
   didst not receive?--I COR. 4:7.

   By the grace of God I am what I am.--Of his own will begat he us with
   the word of truth.--It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
   runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.--Where is boasting then? It is
   excluded.--Christ Jesus, . . . is made unto us wisdom, and
   righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: . . . He that
   glorieth let him glory in the Lord.

   You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; wherein in
   time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to
   the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the
   children of disobedience: among whom also we all had our conversation
   in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the
   flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even
   as others.--Ye are washed, . . . ye are sanctified, . . . ye are
   justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

   OCTOBER 3 MORNING

   Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own
   blood.--REV. 1:5.

   Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it. Love
   is strong as death.--Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay
   down his life for his friends.

   Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we,
   being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye
   were healed.--In whom we have redemption through his blood, the
   forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace.

   Ye are washed, . . . ye are sanctified, . . . ye are justified in the
   name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.--Ye are a chosen
   generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that
   ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of
   darkness into his marvellous light.--I beseech you . . . brethren, by
   the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice,
   holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.

   OCTOBER 3 EVENING

   There are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.--I COR. 12:5.

   Over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the
   storehouses . . . Jehonathan: and over them that did the work of the
   field for tillage of the ground was Ezri: and over the vineyards was
   Shimei. These were the rulers of the substance which was king David's.

   God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets,
   thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
   governments, diversities of tongues. All these worketh that one and the
   selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.

   As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to
   another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man
   speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let
   him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things
   may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion
   for ever and ever.

   I Chr. 27:25-27,31.I Cor. 12:28,11.I Pet. 4:10,11.

   OCTOBER 4 MORNING

   Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with
   him.--EXO. 34:29.

   Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory.--Lord,
   when saw we thee a hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee
   drink?--In lowliness of mind, let each esteem other better than
   themselves.--Be clothed with humility.

   [Jesus] was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the
   sun, and his raiment was white as the light.--All that sat in the
   council, looking stedfastly on Stephen, saw his face as it had been the
   face of an angel.--The glory which thou gavest me, I have given
   them.--We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the
   Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by
   the Spirit of the Lord.

   Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be
   hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a
   candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.

   Psa. 115:1. -Matt. 25:37. -Phi. 2:3. -I Pet. 5:5.Matt. 17:2. -Acts 6:15. -John 17:22. -II Cor. 3:18.Matt. 5:14,15.
     __________________________________________________________________

   OCTOBER 4 EVENING

   There are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which
   worketh all in all.--I COR. 12:6.

   There fell some of Manasseh to David. And they helped David against the
   band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour.--The
   manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal.

   Of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of
   the times, to know what Israel ought to do.--To one is given by the
   Spirit . . . the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by
   the same Spirit.

   Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all
   instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were
   not of double heart.--A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.

   There should be no schism in the body; but . . . the members should
   have the same care one for another. And whether one member suffer, all
   the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members
   rejoice with it.

   One Lord, one faith, one baptism.

   OCTOBER 5 MORNING

   Call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt
   glorify me.--PSA. 50:15.

   Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within
   me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of
   my countenance, and my God.--Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the
   humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to
   hear.--For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in
   mercy unto all them that call upon thee.

   Jacob said unto his household, . . . Let us arise and go up to Bethel;
   and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of
   my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.--Bless the Lord,
   O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.

   I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.
   Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon
   him as long as I live. The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains
   of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. Then called I on
   the name of the Lord.

   Psa. 42:11. -Psa. 10:17. -Psa. 86:5.Gen. 35:2,3. -Psa. 103:2.Psa. 116:1-4.

   OCTOBER 5 EVENING

   Yet a little while, (Gr. how little, how little,) and he that shall
   come will come, and will not tarry.--HEB. 10:37.

   Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that
   readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end
   it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it because it
   will surely come, it will not tarry.

   Beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the
   Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is
   not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is
   longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that
   all should come to repentence.--Thou, O Lord, art a God full of
   compassion, and gracious, longsuffering and plenteous in mercy and
   truth.--Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come
   down. For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor
   perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee,
   what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.

   OCTOBER 6 MORNING

   The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.--REV. 19:6.

   I know that thou canst do every thing.--The things which are impossible
   with men are possible with God.--He doeth according to his will in the
   army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can
   stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?--There is none that
   can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?--Abba,
   Father, all things are possible unto thee.

   Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.
   Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto
   you.--Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus put forth
   his hand and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean.--The mighty
   God.--All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

   Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the
   name of the Lord our God.--Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor
   dismayed, . . . there be more with us than with him.

   Job 42:2. -Luke 18:27. -Dan. 4:35.Isa. 43:13. -Mark 14:36.Matt. 9:28,29. -Matt. 8:2,3.Isa. 9:6. -Matt. 28:18.Psa. 20:7. -II Chr. 32:7.

   OCTOBER 6 EVENING

   What is the thing that the Lord hath said unto thee?--I SAM. 3:17.

   He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord
   require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk
   humbly with thy God?--To keep the commandments of the Lord, and his
   statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good.

   As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is
   written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which
   are written in the book of the law to do them. But that no man is
   justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for The just
   shall live by faith. Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added
   because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the
   promise was made.

   God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto
   the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by
   his Son.

   Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth.

   Mic. 6:8. -Deut. 10:13.Gal. 3:10,11,19.Heb. 1:1,2.I Sam. 3:9.

   OCTOBER 7 MORNING

   The meek will he teach his way.--PSA. 25:9.

   Blessed are the meek.

   I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift,
   nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet
   riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill.--A
   man's heart deviseth his way: but the Lord directeth his steps.

   Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O Thou that dwellest in the heavens.
   Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters,
   and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes
   wait upon the Lord our God.--Cause me to know the way wherein I should
   walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.

   O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this
   great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but
   our eyes are upon thee.

   If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
   liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

   When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all
   truth.

   OCTOBER 7 EVENING

   O Lord God, . . . with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be
   blessed for ever.--II SAM. 7:29.

   Thou blessest, O Lord,and it shall be blessed for ever.--The blessing
   of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.

   Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It more blessed to
   give than to receive.--When thou makest a feast call the poor, the
   maimed, the lame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot
   recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of
   the just.--Come, ye blessed my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
   you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave
   me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and
   took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I
   was in prison, and ye came unto me.

   Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him in
   time of trouble.

   The Lord God is a sun and shield.

   OCTOBER 8 MORNING

   I will not fear what man shall do unto me.--HEB. 13:6.

   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or
   distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
   Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that
   loved us.

   Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more
   that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him,
   which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell: yea, I say
   unto you, Fear him.

   Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for
   theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile
   you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you
   falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your
   reward in heaven.--None of these things move me, neither count I my
   life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy.--I
   will speak of thy testimonies . . . before kings, and will not be
   ashamed.

   OCTOBER 8 EVENING

   He set my feet upon a rock.--PSA. 40:2.

   That Rock was Christ.--Simon Peter . . . said, Thou art the Christ the
   Son of the living God. Upon this rock I will build my church; and the
   gates of hell shall not prevail against it.--Neither is there salvation
   in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among
   men, whereby we must be saved.

   Full assurance of faith. Faith without wavering.--Faith, nothing
   wavering . . . He that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with
   the wind and tossed.

   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or
   distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
   Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that
   loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
   nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
   nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
   separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

     __________________________________________________________________

   OCTOBER 9 MORNING

   Thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful.--NEH. 9:17.

   The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
   slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should
   perish, but that all should come to repentance.--The longsuffering of
   our Lord is salvation.

   For this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might
   shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should
   hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.--Whatsoever things were
   written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through
   patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.

   Despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and
   longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
   repentance?--Rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the
   Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of
   great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.

   OCTOBER 9 EVENING

   The words of the Lord are pure words.--PSA. 12:6.

   Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.--The statutes
   of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord
   is pure, enlightening the eyes.--Every word of God is pure: he is a
   shield unto them that put their trust in him. Add thou not unto his
   words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.

   Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. I
   will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy
   ways.--Brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are
   honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,
   whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if
   there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these
   things.--As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word that ye
   may grow thereby.

   We are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity,
   but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.--Nor handling
   the word of God deceitfully.

   Jesus.--That in the dispensation of the fulness of times, he might
   gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven,
   and which are on earth; even in him.

   He is not ashamed to call them brethren.--Behold my mother and my
   brethren! Whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven,
   the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.--Go to my brethren, and
   say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father.

   I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of
   God, and for the testimony which they held: . . . and white robes were
   given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they
   should rest for a little season, until their fellow-servants also and
   their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be
   fulfilled.--That they without us should not be made perfect.

   Ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.--Ye have not
   received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the
   Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself
   beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.

   Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into
   your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a
   servant, but a son.

   Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in
   my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my
   name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.

   I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my
   sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.

   Be not far from me; for trouble is near.--PSA. 22:11.

   How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever? how long wilt thou hide
   thy face from me? How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having
   sorrow in my heart daily?--Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy
   servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither
   forsake me, O God of my salvation.

   He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in
   trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.--The Lord is nigh unto all
   them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. He will
   fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry,
   and will save them.

   I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.--Lo, I am with
   you alway, even unto the end of the world.

   God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.--Truly
   my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.--My soul, wait
   thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.

   Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee,
   glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?--Holy, holy,
   holy, Lord God Almighty.

   Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.--I saw . . . the Lord
   sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the
   temple. Above it stood the seraphims. And one cried unto another, and
   said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full
   of his glory. Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone.--I have heard of
   thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore
   I abhor myself.

   The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.--That we
   might be partakers of his holiness.--Having therefore, brethren,
   boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, let us draw
   near with a true heart.

   all things unto himself.--Mercy and truth are met together;
   righteousness and peace have kissed each other.

   I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts
   of peace, and not of evil.--Come now, and let us reason together, saith
   the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as
   snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

   Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity?

   Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace.--Work out your own

   kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.--A stone . . . cut out without

   hosts.--The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: neither shall
   they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is
   within you.

   Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God. So is
   the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; and
   should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and
   grow up, he knoweth not how. But when the fruit is brought forth,
   immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.

   Be ye . . . ready: for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man
   cometh.

   OCTOBER 13 MORNING

   From the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and
   to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard. --DAN. 10:12.

   Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name
   is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a
   contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to
   revive the heart of the contrite ones.--The sacrifices of God are a
   broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not
   despise.--Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly:
   but the proud he knoweth afar off.--Humble yourselves therefore under
   the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.--God
   resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.

   Submit yourselves therefore to God.

   Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto
   all them that call upon thee. Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer; and
   attend to the voice of my supplications. In the day of my trouble I
   will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.

   OCTOBER 13 EVENING

   Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.--MATT. 6:10.

   Understanding what the will of the Lord is.

   It is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these
   little ones should perish.

   This is the will of God, even your sanctification.--That he no longer
   should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but
   to the will of God.--Of his own will begat he us with the word of
   truth: wherefore lay apart all filthiness.

   Be ye holy; for I am holy.--[Jesus] said, Whosoever shall do the will
   of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.--Whosoever
   heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a
   wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and the rain descended,
   and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and
   it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.--The world passeth away,
   and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for
   ever.

   Eph. 5:17.Matt. 18:14.I Thes. 4:3. -I Pet. 4:2. -Jas. 1:18,21.I Pet. 1:16. -Mark 3:34,35. -Matt. 7:24,25. -I John 2:17.

   OCTOBER 14 MORNING

   Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of
   the dead and living.--ROM. 14:9.

   It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou
   shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he
   shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
   his hand. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be
   satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many;
   for he shall bear their iniquities.--Ought not Christ to have suffered
   these things, and to enter into his glory?--We thus judge, that if one
   died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they
   which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him
   which died for them, and rose again.

   Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that
   same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.--Who verily
   was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest
   in these last times for you, who by him do believe in God.

   Isa. 53:10,11. -Luke. 24:26. -II Cor. 5:14,15.Acts. 2:36. -I Pet. 1:20,21.
     __________________________________________________________________

   OCTOBER 14 EVENING

   Give us this day our daily bread.--MATT. 6:11.

   I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous
   forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.--His bread shall be given him;
   his waters shall be sure.--The ravens brought him bread and flesh in
   the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the
   brook.

   My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by
   Christ Jesus.--Be content with such things as ye have: for he hath
   said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.

   He humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna,
   . . . that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread
   only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord
   doth man live.--Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the
   true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down
   from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. Then said they unto him,
   Lord, evermore give us this bread.

   Psa. 37:25. -Isa. 33:16. -I Kgs. 17:6.Phi. 4:19. -Heb. 13:5.Deut. 8:3.

   OCTOBER 15 MORNING

   God is my defence.--PSA. 59:9.

   The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; the God of my
   rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my
   salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour.--The Lord is my
   strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped:
   therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise
   him.

   When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall
   lift up a standard against him.--We may boldly say, The Lord is my
   helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

   The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is
   the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

   As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about
   his people from henceforth even for ever.--Because thou hast been my
   help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.

   For thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.

   II Sam. 22:2,3. -Psa. 28:7.Isa. 59:19. -Heb. 13:6.Psa. 27:1.Psa. 125:2.
   -Psa. 63:7.Psa. 31:3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   OCTOBER 15 EVENING

   Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.--MATT. 6:12.

   Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till
   seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven
   times: but, Until seventy times seven.--O thou wicked servant, I
   forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: shouldest not
   thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity
   on thee? And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors,
   till he should pay all that was due unto him. So likewise shall my
   heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not
   every one his brother their trespasses.--Be ye kind one to another,
   tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake
   hath forgiven you.--You, . . . hath he quickened, . . . having forgiven
   you all trespasses; blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was
   against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way,
   nailing it to his cross.--Even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.

   Matt. 18:21,22. -Matt. 18:32-35. -Eph. 4:32. -Col. 2:13,14. -Col. 3:13.
     __________________________________________________________________

   OCTOBER 16 MORNING

   Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.--ROM. 12:11.

   Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is
   no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither
   thou goest.--Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not
   unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
   inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.--Whatsoever good thing any
   man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord.

   I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night
   cometh, when no man can work.--Wist ye not that I must be about my
   Father's business?--The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.

   Brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if
   ye do these things, ye shall never fall.--We desire that every one of
   you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the
   end; that ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith
   and perseverence inherit the promises.--So run, that ye may obtain.

   Eccl. 9:10. -Col. 3:23,24. -Eph. 6:8.John 9:4. -Luke 2:49. -John 2:17.II Pet. 1:10. -Heb. 6:11,12. -I Cor. 9:24.
     __________________________________________________________________

   OCTOBER 16 EVENING

   Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.--MATT. 6:13.

   He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely,
   he shall be delivered.

   Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot
   be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is
   tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.--Wherefore
   come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch
   not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.

   Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was
   well watered every where, . . . even as the garden of the Lord. Then
   Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; but the men of Sodom were wicked
   and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.--[The Lord] delivered just
   Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked. The Lord knoweth
   how to deliver the godly out of temptations.--Yea, he shall be holden
   up: for God is able to make him stand.

   Prov. 28:26.Jas. 1:13,14. -II Cor. 6:17.Gen. 13:10,11,13. -II Pet. 2:7,9. -Rom. 14:4.
     __________________________________________________________________

   OCTOBER 17 MORNING

   In thy name shall they rejoice all the day; and in thy righteousness
   shall they be exalted.--PSA. 89:16.

   In the Lord have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men
   come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed. In the
   Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.--Be
   glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye
   that are upright in heart.

   The righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed
   by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God which is by
   faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe. To
   declare . . . at this time his righteousness: that he might be just,
   and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

   Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.--Whom having not
   seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye
   rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.

   Isa. 45:24,25. -Psa. 32:11.Rom. 3:21,22,26.Phi. 4:4. -I Pet. 1:8.
     __________________________________________________________________

   OCTOBER 17 EVENING

   Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.--MATT. 6:13.

   The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with majesty: thy throne is
   established of old: thou art from everlasting.

   The Lord is . . . great in power.--If God be for us, who can be against
   us?--Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us, and he will deliver
   us.--My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is
   able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.--Greater is he that is in
   you, than he that is in the world.

   Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory.--Thine,
   O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the
   victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the
   earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as
   head above all. Now therefore, our God, we thank thee and praise thy
   glorious name. But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be
   able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of
   thee, and of thine own have we given thee.

   OCTOBER 18 MORNING

   One of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came
   there out blood and water.--JOHN 19:34.

   Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with
   you.--The life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you
   upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls.--It is not possible
   that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.

   Jesus said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is
   shed for many.--By his own blood he entered in once into the holy
   place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.--Peace through the
   blood of his cross.

   Ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver
   and gold, . . . but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb
   without blemish and without spot, . . . manifest in these last times
   for you.

   Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean: . . .
   from all your idols, will I cleanse you.--Let us draw near with a true
   heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an
   evil conscience.

   OCTOBER 18 EVENING

   Amen--MATT. 6:13.

   Amen: the Lord God . . . say so too.--He who blesseth himself in the
   earth shall bless himself in the God of truth (Heb. The Amen) and he
   that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth (The Amen).

   When God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater,
   he sware by himself. For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath
   for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. Wherein God, willing
   more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of
   his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things, in
   which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong
   consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
   before us.

   These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness.--For all
   the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of
   God by us.

   Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous
   things. And blessed be his glorious name for ever. Amen, and Amen.

   OCTOBER 19 MORNING

   The Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being
   taken.--PROV. 3:26.

   Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt
   thou restrain.--The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the
   rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.--When a man's
   ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with
   him.

   I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My
   soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that wait for the morning: I
   say, more than they that watch for the morning.--I sought the Lord, and
   he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.

   The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms:
   and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say,
   Destroy them.--Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose
   hope the Lord is.

   What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be
   against us?

   OCTOBER 19 EVENING

   Consolation in Christ, . . . comfort of love, . . . fellowship of the
   Spirit.--PHI. 2:1.

   Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He
   cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a
   shadow, and continueth not.--My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is
   the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.

   The Father . . . shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide
   with you for ever: the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
   name.--Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
   Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all
   our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any
   trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.

   If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them which sleep
   in Jesus will God bring with him. And so shall we ever be with the
   Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

   Job 14:1,2. -Psa. 73:26.John 14:16,26. -II Cor. 1:3,4.I Thes. 4:14,17,18.

   OCTOBER 20 MORNING

   I delight in the law of God after the inward man.--ROM. 7:22.

   O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.--Thy words were
   found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and
   rejoicing of mine heart.--I sat down under his shadow with great
   delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.--I have esteemed the
   words of his mouth more than my necessary food.

   I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
   heart.--My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish
   his work.

   The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the
   commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes. More to be
   desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than
   honey and the honeycomb.--Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers
   only, deceiving your own selves. For if any be a hearer of the word,
   and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a
   glass.

   Psa. 119:97. -Jer. 15:16. -Song 2:3. -Job 23:12.Psa. 40:8. -John 4:34.Psa. 19:8,10. -Jas. 1:22,23.
     __________________________________________________________________

   OCTOBER 20 EVENING

   The Lord thy God accept thee.--II SAM. 24:23.

   Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high
   God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a
   year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten
   thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my
   transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? He hath
   shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of
   thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy
   God?

   We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as
   filthy rags.--There is none righteous, no, not one. For all have
   sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by
   his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath
   set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood. To declare .
   . . at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the
   justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

   Accepted in the Beloved.--Ye are complete in him.

   Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.--JOHN 1:16.

   This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.--Behold, what manner
   of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the
   sons of God.

   His Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things.--If children, then
   heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we
   suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.

   I and my Father are one. The Father is in me, and I in him.--My Father,
   and your Father; and . . . my God, and your God.--I in them, and thou
   in me, that they may be made perfect in one.

   The Church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in
   all.

   Having . . . these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves
   from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the
   fear of God.

   OCTOBER 21 EVENING

   The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent
   greater than he that sent him. If ye know these things, happy are ye if
   ye do them.--JOHN 13:16,17.

   There was . . . a strife among them, which of them should be accounted
   the greatest. And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise
   lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are
   called benefactors. But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest
   among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that
   doth serve. For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that
   serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that
   serveth.--Even the Son man came not to be ministered unto, but to
   minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

   Jesus riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments, and took a
   towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth water into a basin,
   and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel
   wherewith he was girded.

   Luke 22:24-27. -Matt. 20:28.John 13:3-5.
     __________________________________________________________________

   OCTOBER 22 MORNING

   O God, my heart is fixed.--PSA. 108:1.

   The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is
   the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

   Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee:
   because he trusteth in thee.--He shall not be afraid of evil tidings:
   his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord. His heart is established, he
   shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.

   What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.--In the time of trouble he
   shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he
   hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. And now shall mine head be
   lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in
   his tabernacle sacrifices of joy: I will sing, yea, I will sing praises
   unto the Lord.

   The God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by
   Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered awhile, make you perfect,
   stablish, strengthen, settle you. To him be glory and dominion for ever
   and ever.

   OCTOBER 22 EVENING

   The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom
   ruleth over all.--PSA. 103:19.

   The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the
   Lord.--Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?

   I am the Lord, and there is none else; there is no God beside me: I
   girded thee, though thou hast not known me: that they may know from the
   rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I
   am the Lord, and there is none else. I form the light, and create
   darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these
   things.

   He doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the
   inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him,
   What doest thou?--If God be for us, who can be against us?

   He must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.--Fear not,
   little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the
   kingdom.

     __________________________________________________________________

   OCTOBER 23 MORNING

   A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he
   possesseth.--LUKE 12:15.

   A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many
   wicked.--Better is little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure
   and trouble therewith.--Godliness with contentment is great gain.
   Having food and raiment let us be therewith content.

   Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for
   me: lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I
   be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.--Give us this
   day our daily bread.

   Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
   drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life
   more than meat, and the body than raiment?--When I sent you without
   purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said,
   Nothing.--Let your conversation be without covetousness: and be content
   with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee,
   nor forsake thee.

   Psa. 37:16. -Prov. 15:16. -I Tim. 6:6,8.Prov. 30:8,9. -Matt. 6:11.Matt. 6:25. -Luke 22:35. -Heb. 13:5.
     __________________________________________________________________

   OCTOBER 23 EVENING

   It is the spirit that quickeneth.--JOHN 6:63.

   The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a
   quickening spirit.--That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that
   which is born of the Spirit is spirit.--Not by works of righteousness
   which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the
   washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.

   If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if
   Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is
   life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of him that raised up
   Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the
   dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth
   in you.

   I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now
   live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God.--Reckon ye . .
   . yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through
   Jesus Christ our Lord.

   OCTOBER 24 MORNING

   I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy
   temple.--JON. 2:4.

   Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.
   Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
   compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not
   forget thee.

   I forgat prosperity. And I said, My strength and my hope is perished
   from the Lord.--Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not
   off for ever.--Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way
   is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is passed over from my God?--In a
   little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting
   kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer.

   Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within
   me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my
   countenance.--We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are
   perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down,
   but not destroyed.

   Isa. 49:14,15.Lam. 3:17,18. -Psa. 44:23. -Isa. 40:27. -Isa. 54:8.Psa. 43:5. -II Cor. 4:8,9.

   OCTOBER 24 EVENING

   When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue
   faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them.--ISA. 41:17.

   There be many that say, Who will shew us any good?--What hath man of
   all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath
   laboured under the sun? For all his days are sorrows, and his travail
   grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. All is vanity and
   vexation of spirit.--They have forsaken me the fountain of living
   waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no
   water.

   Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.--I will pour water
   upon him that is thirsty.--Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst
   after righteousness: for they shall be filled.

   O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for
   thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no
   water is.

   Psa. 4:6. -Eccl. 2:22,23,17. -Jer. 2:13.John 6:37. -Isa. 44:3. -Matt. 5:6.Psa. 63:1.

   OCTOBER 25 MORNING

   Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.--MATT. 28:20.

   If two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they
   shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
   For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in
   the midst of them.--He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he
   it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my
   Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

   Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto
   the world? . . . If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father
   will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.

   Unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you
   faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the
   only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power,
   both now and ever. Amen.

   Matt. 18:19,20. -John 14:21.John 14:2223.Jude 24,25.

   OCTOBER 25 EVENING

   The end of all things is at hand.--I PET. 4:7.

   I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the
   earth and the heaven fled away.--The heavens and the earth, which are
   now, . . . are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of
   judgment.

   God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
   Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the
   mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters
   thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the
   swelling thereof.--Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that
   ye be not troubled.

   We have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the
   heavens.--We . . . look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein
   dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for
   such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without
   spot, and blameless.

   Rev. 20:11. -II Pet. 3:7.Psa. 46:1-3. -Matt. 24:6.II Cor. 5:1. -II Pet. 3:13,14.
     __________________________________________________________________

   OCTOBER 26 MORNING

   The Lord reigneth.--PSA. 99:1.

   Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye not tremble at my presence,
   which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual
   decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss
   themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they
   not pass over it?--Promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the
   west, nor from the south. But God is the judge: he putteth down one,
   and setteth up another.

   He changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth
   up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that
   know understanding.--Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see
   that ye be not troubled.

   If God be for us, who can be against us?--Are not two sparrows sold for
   a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your
   Father. The very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not
   therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.

   Jer. 5:22. -Psa. 75:6,7.Dan. 2:21. -Matt. 24:6.Rom. 8:31. -Matt. 10:29-31.

   OCTOBER 26 EVENING

   Take heed to your spirit.--MAL. 2:15.

   Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him,
   because he followeth not with us. And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him
   not: for he that is not against us is for us. Lord, wilt thou that we
   command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias
   did? But he . . . rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of
   spirit ye are of.

   Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. And Joshua the son of Nun . .
   . answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. And Moses said unto
   him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the Lord'speople were
   prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!

   The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
   goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.--And they that are Christ's have
   crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the
   Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Let us not be desirous of vain
   glory, provoking one another, envying one another.

   Luke 9:49,50,54,55.Num. 11:27-29.Gal. 5:22,23. -Gal. 5:24-27.

   OCTOBER 27 MORNING

   Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.--MATT. 8:17.

   Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed
   two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: and
   the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen
   vessel over running water: as for the living bird, he shall take it,
   and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them
   and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the
   running water: and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed
   from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall
   let the living bird loose into the open field.

   Behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and
   besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me
   clean.--And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and
   touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean. And as soon as
   he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was
   cleansed.

   Lev. 14:4-7.Luke 5:12. -Mark 1:41,42.

   OCTOBER 27 EVENING

   He whom thou blessest is blessed.--NUM. 22:6.

   Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

   Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are
   the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they which do
   hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
   Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the
   pure in heart: for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers: for
   they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which are
   persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of
   heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you,
   and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
   Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in
   heaven.--Blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.

   Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to
   the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.

   Matt. 5:3-12. -Luke 11:28.Rev. 22:14.

   OCTOBER 28 MORNING

   He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no
   intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him.--ISA. 59:16.

   Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire: mine ears hast thou
   opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. Then
   said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I
   delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.--I
   lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me,
   but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have
   power to take it again.

   There is no God else beside me: a just God and a Saviour; there is none
   beside me. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth:
   for I am God, and there is none else.--There is none other name under
   heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

   Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich,
   yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be
   rich.

   Psa. 40:6-8. -John 10:17,18.Isa. 45:21,22. -Acts 4:12.II Cor. 8:9.

   OCTOBER 28 EVENING

   The Enemy.--LUKE 10:19.

   Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring
   lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.--Resist the devil, and
   he will flee from you.

   Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against
   the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
   against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
   darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
   Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to
   withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand
   therefore having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the
   breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the preparation
   of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith,
   wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

   Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when
   I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me.

   I Pet. 5:8. -Jas. 4:7.Eph. 6:11-16.Mic. 7:8.

   OCTOBER 29 MORNING

   He is altogether lovely.--SONG 5:16.

   My meditation of him shall be sweet.--My beloved is . . . the chiefest
   among ten thousand.--A chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that
   believeth on him shall not be confounded.--Thou art fairer than the
   children of men: grace is poured into thy lips.--God . . . hath highly
   exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name.--It
   pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.

   Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet
   believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.

   I count all things but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of
   Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things,
   and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him,
   not having mine own righteousness which is of the law, but that which
   is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by
   faith.

   OCTOBER 29 EVENING

   David encouraged himself in the Lord his God.--I SAM. 30:6.

   Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.--I know
   whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that
   which I have committed unto him against that day.

   In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he heard
   my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his
   ears. They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the Lord was my
   stay. He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
   because he delighted in me.

   I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in
   my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall
   hear thereof, and be glad. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt
   his name together. I sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me
   from all my fears. O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is
   the man that trusteth in him.

   OCTOBER 30 MORNING

   It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the
   salvation of the Lord.--LAM. 3:26.

   Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender
   mercies?--I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
   nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried
   unto thee.

   Shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him,
   though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them
   speedily.--Wait on the Lord, and he shall save thee.--Rest in the Lord,
   and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who
   prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices
   to pass.

   Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye
   still, and see the salvation of the Lord.

   Let us not be weary in well doing: . . . in due season we shall reap,
   if we faint not.--Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit
   of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early
   and latter rain.

   OCTOBER 30 EVENING

   Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our
   vines have tender grapes.--SONG 2:15.

   Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
   faults.--Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest
   any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be
   defiled.--Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey
   the truth?

   He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of
   Jesus Christ: only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel
   of Christ.--The tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.
   Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a
   fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it
   defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and
   it is set on fire of hell. The tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly
   evil, full of deadly poison.--Let your speech be alway with grace,
   seasoned with salt.

   OCTOBER 31 MORNING

   Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of
   hosts.--ZECH. 4:6.

   Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his counsellor hath
   taught him?

   God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise;
   and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things
   which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are
   despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to
   nought things that are: that no flesh should glory in his presence.

   The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof,
   but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every
   one that is born of the Spirit.--Born not of blood, nor of the will of
   the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

   My Spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.--The battle is not yours,
   but God's.

   The Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the Lord's.

   Isa. 40:13.I Cor. 1:27-29.John 3:8. -John 1:13.Hag. 2:5. -II Chr. 20:15.I Sam. 17:47.

   OCTOBER 31 EVENING

   Do as thou hast said.--II SAM. 7:25.

   Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear. So
   shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust
   in thy word. Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast
   caused me to hope. Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my
   pilgrimage. The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of
   gold and silver. For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven. Thy
   faithfulness is unto all generations.

   God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the
   immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath; that by two
   immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might
   have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
   the hope set before us: which hope we have as an anchor of the soul,
   both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
   whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus.

   Exceeding great and precious promises.

   NOVEMBER 1 MORNING

   Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting
   at the posts of my doors.--PROV. 8:34.

   Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters,
   and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes
   wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us.

   A continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of
   the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord: where I will meet
   you, to speak there unto thee.--In all places where I record my name I
   will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.

   Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the
   midst of them.

   The hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship
   the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to
   worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship
   him in spirit and in truth.

   Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit.--Pray
   without ceasing.

   NOVEMBER 1 EVENING

   His name shall be called Counsellor.--ISA. 9:6.

   The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and
   understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of
   knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord. And shall make him of quick
   understanding in the fear of the Lord.

   Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? Unto you, O
   men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. O ye simple,
   understand wisdom: and ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. Hear;
   for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall
   be right things. Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding;
   I have strength.

   The Lord of hosts . . . is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in
   working.--If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
   all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given
   him.--Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine
   own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct
   thy paths.

     __________________________________________________________________

   NOVEMBER 2 MORNING

   Ever follow that which is good.--I THES. 5:15.

   For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us,
   leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin,
   neither was guile found in his mouth: who, when he was reviled, reviled
   not again; . . . but committed himself to him that judgeth
   righteously.--Consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
   against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.

   Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset
   us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
   looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the
   joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and
   is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

   Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are
   honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,
   whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report: if
   there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.

   I Pet. 2:21-23. -Heb. 12:3.Heb. 12:1,2.Phi. 4:8.

   NOVEMBER 2 EVENING

   The mighty God.--ISA. 9:6.

   Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy
   lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. Gird thy sword upon thy
   thigh, O most Mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy
   majesty ride prosperously . . . Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
   ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.--Thou spakest in
   vision to thy Holy One, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is
   mighty.--The man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts.

   Behold, God, is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the
   Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my
   salvation.--Thanks be unto God, which always causes us to triumph in
   Christ.

   Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you
   faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the
   only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power,
   both now and ever.

   The ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them: but
   the transgressors shall fall therein.--HOS. 14:9.

   Unto you . . . which believe he is precious: but unto them which be
   disobedient, . . . a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence.--The
   way of the Lord is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to
   the workers of iniquity.

   He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.--Whoso is wise, and will
   observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of
   the Lord.--The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be
   single, thy whole body shall be full of light.--If any man will do his
   will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God.--Whosoever
   hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance.

   He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not,
   because ye are not of God.--Ye will not come unto me, that ye might
   have life.--My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow

   I and my Father are one, the Father is in me, and I in him.--Had ye had
   known me, ye should have known my Father also.--Philip saith unto him,
   Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him,
   Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me,
   Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father.--Behold I and the
   children which God hath given me.--He shall see of the travail of his
   soul, and shall be satisfied.--I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and
   the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to
   come, the Almighty.--Before Abraham was, I am.--God said unto Moses, I
   AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of
   Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.

   Unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever.--He is
   before all things, and by him all things consist.--In him dwelleth all
   the fulness of the Godhead bodily.

   NOVEMBER 4 MORNING

   Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold
   temptations.--I PET. 1:6.

   Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to
   try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice,
   inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his
   glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.--The
   exhortation . . . speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise
   not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of
   him.--Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but
   grievous: nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
   righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.

   We have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of
   our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
   without sin.--For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is
   able to succour them that are tempted.--God is faithful, who will not
   suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able.

   I Pet. 4:12,13. -Heb. 12:5. -Heb. 12:11.Heb. 4:15. -Heb. 2:18. -I Cor. 10:13.

   NOVEMBER 4 EVENING

   The Prince of Peace.--ISA. 9:6.

   He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with
   judgment. The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little
   hills, by righteousness. He shall come down like rain upon the mown
   grass; as showers that water the earth. In his days shall the righteous
   flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.--Glory
   to God . . . on earth peace, good will toward men.

   Through the tender mercy of our God; . . . the dayspring from on high
   hath visited us. To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the
   shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace;--peace by
   Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all).

   These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In
   the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have
   overcome the world.--Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you:
   not as the world giveth give I unto you.--The peace of God, which
   passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through
   Christ Jesus.

   Psa. 72:2-7. -Luke. 2:14.Luke. 1:78,79. -Acts 10:36.John 16:33. -John 14:27. -Phi. 4:7.

   NOVEMBER 5 MORNING

   Take thou also unto thee principal spices, and thou shalt make it an
   oil of holy ointment.--EXO. 30:23,25.

   Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any
   other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be
   holy unto you.--One Spirit.--Diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.

   Thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
   fellows.--God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
   power.--God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.

   Of his fulness have all we received.--As the same anointing teacheth
   you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath
   taught you, ye shall abide in him.--He which . . . hath anointed us, is
   God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in
   our hearts.

   The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
   goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

   NOVEMBER 5 EVENING

   The fashion of this world passeth away.--I COR. 7:31.

   All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and
   he died.

   Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: but the
   rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he
   shall pass away. For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning beat,
   but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the
   grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade
   away in his ways.--For what is your life? It is even a vapour of that
   appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.--The world
   passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God
   abideth for ever.

   Lord, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is;
   that I may know how frail I am.--When they shall say, Peace and safety;
   then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with
   child; and they shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not in
   darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.

   Gen. 5:27.Jas. 1:9-11. -Jas. 4:14. -I John 2:17.Psa. 39:4. -I Thes. 5:3,4.
     __________________________________________________________________

   NOVEMBER 6 MORNING

   When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear
   with him in glory.--COL. 3:4.

   I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he
   were dead, yet shall he live.--God hath given to us eternal life, and
   this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that
   hath not the Son of God hath not life.

   The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice
   of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ
   shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
   together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
   shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with
   these words.--When he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall
   see him as he is.--It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory; it
   is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.

   If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you
   unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.

   John 11:25. -I John 5:11,12.I Thes. 4:16-18. -I John 3:2. -I Cor. 15:43.John 14:3.

   NOVEMBER 6 EVENING

   Lead me in thy truth, and teach me--PSA. 25:5.

   When . . . the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all
   truth.--Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.

   To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this
   word, it is because there is no light in them.--All scripture is given
   by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
   correction, for instruction in righteousness; That the man of God may
   be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.--The holy
   Scriptures . . . are able to make thee wise unto salvation through
   faith which is in Christ Jesus.

   I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I
   will guide thee with mine eye.--The light of the body is the eye: if
   therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of
   light.--If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
   whether it be of God.--The wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err
   therein.

   NOVEMBER 7 MORNING

   Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his
   wonderful works to the children of men!--PSA. 107:8.

   O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth
   in him.--How great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
   that fear thee!

   This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my
   praise.--Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
   Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the
   praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in
   the beloved. That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first
   trusted in Christ.

   How great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty!--The Lord is
   good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. All thy
   works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee. They
   shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make
   known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of
   his kingdom.

     __________________________________________________________________

   NOVEMBER 7 EVENING

   Behold, we count them happy which endure.--JAS. 5:11.

   We glory in tribulations: . . . knowing that tribulation worketh
   patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope: And hope
   maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our
   hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.--No chastening for the
   present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it
   yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are
   exercised thereby.--My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into
   divers temptations; knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh
   patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be
   perfect and entire, wanting nothing. Blessed is the man that endureth
   temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life,
   which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.--Most gladly
   therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of
   Christ may rest upon me. For when I am weak, then am I strong.

   Rom. 5:3-5. -Heb. 12:11. -Jas. 1:2-4,12. -II Cor. 12:9,10.
     __________________________________________________________________

   NOVEMBER 8 MORNING

   Let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of
   faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.--I THES. 5:8.

   Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the
   grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus
   Christ.--Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and
   having on the breastplate of righteousness; above all, taking the
   shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery
   darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of
   the Spirit, which is the word of God.

   He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away
   tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take
   away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it. And it shall
   be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and
   he will save us: this is the Lord; . . . we will be glad and rejoice in
   his salvation.

   Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
   seen.

   NOVEMBER 8 EVENING

   The children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of
   kids; but the Syrians filled the country.--I KGS. 20:27.

   Thus saith the Lord, because the Syrians have said, the Lord is a God
   of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys; therefore will I
   deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know
   that I am the Lord. And they pitched one over against the other seven
   days; and so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and
   the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen
   in one day.--Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them;
   because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.

   Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I
   will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee
   with the right hand of my righteousness.

   They shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee;
   for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.

   NOVEMBER 9 MORNING

   I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out
   of the people.--PSA. 89:19.

   I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.--There is
   one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ
   Jesus.--There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby
   we must be saved.

   The mighty God.--Who made himself of no reputation, and took upon him
   the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being
   found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto
   death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly
   exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name.--We see
   Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of
   death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God
   should taste death for every man.--Forasmuch . . . as the children are
   partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the
   same.

   Isa. 43:11. -I Tim. 2:5. -Acts 4:12.Isa. 9:6. -Phi. 2:7-9. -Heb. 2:9.

   NOVEMBER 9 EVENING

   Gather my saints together unto me, those that have made a covenant with
   me by sacrifice.--PSA. 50:5.

   Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that
   look for him shall he appear the second time, without sin, unto
   salvation.--He is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of
   death, . . . they which are called might receive the promise of eternal
   inheritance.

   Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me
   where I am.--Then he shall send his angels, and shall gather together
   his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth, to
   the uttermost part of heaven.--If any of thine be driven out unto the
   outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee,
   and from thence will he fetch thee.

   The dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain
   shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet be Lord in
   the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

   NOVEMBER 10 MORNING

   Fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of
   God.--COL. 1:10.

   I beseech you, . . . brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present
   your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is
   your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye
   transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is
   that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.--As ye have
   yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto
   iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto
   holiness.--In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision, but a new creature. And as many as walk according to
   this rule, peace be on them, and mercy.

   Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be
   my disciples.--I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go
   and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that
   whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.

   NOVEMBER 10 EVENING

   I sought him, but I found him not.--SONG 3:1.

   Return unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.
   Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take away all
   iniquity, and receive us graciously.

   Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God. But every man
   is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Do not
   err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect gift is
   from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no
   variableness, neither shadow of turning.

   Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine
   heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.--It is good that a man should both
   hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.--Shall not God
   avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear
   long with them?

   Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. My soul,
   wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.

   He led them on safely.--PSA. 78:53.

   I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of
   judgment.

   Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to
   bring thee into the place which I have prepared.--In all their
   affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them:
   in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and
   carried them all the days of old.

   They got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did
   their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the
   light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.--So
   didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.

   Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy
   way straight before my face.--O send out thy light and thy truth: let
   them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy
   tabernacles. Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my
   exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.

   NOVEMBER 11 EVENING

   Ye are washed, . . . ye are sanctified, . . . ye are justified.--I COR. 6:11.

   The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.--The
   chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are
   healed.

   Christ . . . loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might
   sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he
   might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or
   wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without
   blemish.--To her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen,
   clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of
   saints.--Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
   having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies
   washed with pure water.

   Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that
   justifieth.--Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven. Blessed is
   the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit
   there is no guile.

   Godly sorrow worketh repentance not to be repented of.--II COR. 7:10.

   Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the
   cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept
   bitterly.--If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
   us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.--The blood of
   Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.

   Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look
   up; they are more than the hairs of my head: therefore my heart faileth
   me. Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me: O Lord, make haste to help me.

   Turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God
   continually.

   The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite
   heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.--He healeth the broken in heart,
   and bindeth up their wounds.--He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good:
   and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love
   mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?

   Is it well with thee? And she answered, it is well.--II KGS. 4:26.

   We having the same spirit of faith.

   As chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as
   poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all
   things.

   We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed,
   but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not
   destroyed; always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord
   Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
   For which cause we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet
   the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which
   is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal
   weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at
   the things which are not seen.

   Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in
   health, even as thy soul prospereth.

   NOVEMBER 13 MORNING

   Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; that he might
   sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.--EPH. 5:25,26.

   Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for
   us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.

   Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the
   word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.--Sanctify them through
   thy truth: thy word is truth.--Except a man be born of water and of the
   Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.--Not by works of
   righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved
   us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
   Ghost.--Thy word hath quickened me.

   The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of
   the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are
   right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure,
   enlightening the eyes.

   I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.

   Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may
   be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will
   do it. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
   Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of
   truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither
   knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in
   you.--There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one
   hope of your calling; oneLord, one faith, one baptism, one God and
   Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.--When
   ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven.

   Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the
   blood of Jesus, by a new and living way . . . let us draw near.

   NOVEMBER 14 MORNING

   Thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.--PSA. 40:17.

   The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in
   his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the
   Lord upholdeth him with his hand.--In the fear of the Lord is strong
   confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.--Who art
   thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the
   son of man which shall be made as grass; and forgettest the Lord thy
   maker?

   I am with thee to deliver thee.--Be strong and of a good courage, fear
   not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go
   with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

   I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the
   morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my
   trouble.--Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from
   trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.

   How wilt thou do in the swellings of Jordan?--JER. 12:5.

   For Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest.

   The priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on
   dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over
   on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.

   We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the
   suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace
   of God should taste death for every man.

   Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
   evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort
   me.--When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
   through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.

   Fear not; I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was
   dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of
   hell and of death.

   Josh. 3:15.Josh. 3:17.Heb. 2:9.Psa. 23:4. -Isa. 43:2.Rev. 1:17,18.

   NOVEMBER 15 MORNING

   God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son
   Jesus Christ our Lord.--I COR. 1:9.

   Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; for he
   is faithful that promised.--God hath said, I will dwell in them, and
   walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my
   people.--Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son
   Jesus Christ.--Rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's
   sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also
   with exceeding joy.

   That ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend
   with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
   and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might
   be filled with all the fulness of God.

   Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in
   him, and he in God.--And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in
   him, and he in him.

   We are his workmanship.--EPH. 2:10.

   They brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the
   foundation of the house.--The house, when it was in building, was built
   of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was
   neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while
   it was in building.

   Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house.--Built upon
   the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being
   the chief corner stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together
   groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded
   together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.--Which in time
   past were not a people, but are now the people of God.

   Ye are God's building.--Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new
   creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become
   new.--Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who
   also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

   NOVEMBER 16 MORNING

   Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.--JOHN 17:17.

   Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.--Let
   the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.

   Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto
   according to thy word. With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me
   not wander from thy commandments.

   When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto
   thy soul: discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep
   thee.

   My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
   Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have
   esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.--I have
   more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my
   meditation.--If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples
   indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

   John 15:3. -Col. 3:16.Psa. 119:9,10.Prov. 2:10,11.Job 23:11,12. -Psa. 119:99. -John 8:31,32.

   NOVEMBER 16 EVENING

   Fellow citizens with the saints.--EPH. 2:19.

   Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the
   heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the
   general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in
   heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men
   made perfect.

   These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having
   seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and
   confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.--Our
   conversation (Gr. citizenship) is in heaven; from whence also we look
   for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body,
   that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the
   working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.--The
   Father, . . . hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
   translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.

   As strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war
   against the soul.

   Heb. 12:22,23.Heb. 11:13. -Phi. 3:20,21. -Col. 1:12,13.I Pet. 2:11.

   NOVEMBER 17 MORNING

   Thy thoughts are very deep.--PSA. 92:5.

   We . . . do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be
   filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
   understanding.--That ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able
   to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and
   depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth
   knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.

   O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how
   unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!--My
   thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith
   the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
   higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.--Many, O
   Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy
   thoughts which are to usward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto
   thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be
   numbered.

   NOVEMBER 17 EVENING

   Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.--GAL. 6:7.

   They that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.--They have
   sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind.--He that soweth to
   his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption.

   To him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.--He that
   soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. And let
   us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we
   faint not. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all
   men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

   There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that
   withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.--The liberal
   soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also
   himself.--He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he
   which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

   Job 4:8. -Hos. 8:7. -Gal. 6:8.Prov. 11:18. -Gal. 6:8-10.Prov. 11:24.

   NOVEMBER 18 MORNING

   He stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.--ISA. 27:8.

   Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord; for his mercies are
   great.--I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee: . . . I will
   correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether
   unpunished.--He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger
   for ever. He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
   according to our iniquities. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth
   that we are dust.--I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that
   serveth him.

   God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye
   are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that
   ye may be able to bear it.--Satan hath desired to have you, that he may
   sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.

   Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his
   distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the
   blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.

   NOVEMBER 18 EVENING

   I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it; and,
   behold, the half was not told me.--I KGS. 10:7.

   The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
   generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts
   of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than
   Solomon is here.--We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
   begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.

   My speech and my preaching was . . . in demonstration of the Spirit and
   of power: that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in
   the power of God. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear
   heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God
   hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto
   us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep
   things of God.

   Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty.--We shall see him as he
   is.--In my flesh I shall see God.--I shall be satisfied.

   Matt. 12:42. -John 1:14.I Cor. 2:4,5,9,10.Isa. 33:17. -I John 3:2. -Job 19:26. -Psa. 17:15.

   NOVEMBER 19 MORNING

   By their fruits ye shall know them.--MATT. 7:20.

   Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is
   righteous, even as he is righteous.--Doth a fountain send forth at the
   same place sweet water and bitter? Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear
   olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt
   water and fresh. Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you?
   let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of
   wisdom.--Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that,
   whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good
   works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.

   Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree
   corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.--A
   good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good
   things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil
   things.

   What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in
   it?

   NOVEMBER 19 EVENING

   I will make the place of my feet glorious.--ISA. 60:13.

   Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my
   footstool.

   Will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth! Behold, heaven and
   the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house
   which I have built!

   Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Yet once, it is a little while, and I
   will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
   and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come:
   and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts. The
   glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith
   the Lord of hosts.

   I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first
   earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I heard a great
   voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men,
   and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God
   himself shall be with them, and be their God.

   Isa. 66:1.II Chr. 6:18.Hag. 2:6,7,9.Rev. 21:1,3.

   NOVEMBER 20 MORNING

   When I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me.--MIC. 7:8.

   When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through
   the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the
   fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon
   thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy
   Saviour.--I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will
   lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light
   before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto
   them, and not forsake them.

   Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
   fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort
   me.--What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. In God I will praise
   his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do
   unto me.--The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
   Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

   NOVEMBER 20 EVENING

   One God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.--I TIM. 2:5.

   Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.--A mediator is not a
   mediator of one, but God is one.

   We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have
   done wickedly. Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they
   remembered not the multitude of thy mercies . . . Therefore he said
   that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him
   in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.

   Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider
   the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; who was
   faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all
   his house.

   He is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon
   better promises. I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their
   sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.

   Deut. 6:4. -Gal. 3:20.Psa. 106:6,7,23.Heb. 3:1-3.Heb. 8:6,12.

   NOVEMBER 21 MORNING

   Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.--JOHN 6:37.

   It shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I
   am gracious.--I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to
   destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the
   Lord their God.--I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of
   thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.

   Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins
   be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
   crimson, they shall be as wool.--Let the wicked forsake his way, and
   the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and
   he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly
   pardon.--Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus
   said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in
   paradise.

   A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not
   quench.

   NOVEMBER 21 EVENING

   His dear Son.--COL. 1:13.

   Lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
   well pleased.--Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my
   soul delighteth.--The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the
   Father.

   In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent
   his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
   Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent
   his son to be the propitiation for our sins. And we have known and
   believed the love that God hath to us. God is love.

   The glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one,
   even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made
   perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and
   hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.--Behold, what manner of love
   the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of
   God.

   NOVEMBER 22 MORNING

   Praying in the Holy Ghost.--JUDE 20.

   God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit
   and in truth.--We . . . have access by one Spirit unto the Father.

   O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless
   not as I will, but as thou wilt.

   The Spirit . . . helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we
   should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession
   for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth
   the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh
   intercession for the saints according to the will of God.--This is the
   confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to
   his will, he heareth us.--When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he
   will guide you into all truth.

   Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and
   watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication.

   NOVEMBER 22 EVENING

   There is a hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout
   again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.--JOB 14:7.

   A bruised reed shall he not break.--He restoreth my soul.

   Godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but
   the sorrow of the world worketh death.--No chastening for the present
   seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth
   the peaceful fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised
   thereby.

   Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy
   word.--After all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our
   great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our
   iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this.

   Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when
   I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me. He will bring me
   forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.

   NOVEMBER 23 MORNING

   Whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from
   fear of evil.--PROV. 1:33.

   Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.--He that
   dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the
   shadow of the Almighty.--His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

   Your life is hid with Christ in God.--He that toucheth you toucheth the
   apple of his eye.--Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of
   the Lord. The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your
   peace.--God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
   Therefore will not we fear.

   Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not
   afraid.--Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
   Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see ;
   for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.--I know whom
   I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I
   have committed unto him against that day.

   My kingdom is not of this world.--JOHN 18:36.

   This man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat
   down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his
   enemies may be made his footstool.--Hereafter shall ye see the Son of
   man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of
   heaven.

   He must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.

   Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
   Christ.--He raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand
   in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and
   might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this
   world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under
   his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,
   which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.--He
   shall shew who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings,
   and Lord of lords.

   NOVEMBER 24 MORNING

   My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do
   it.--LUKE 8:21.

   Both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one:
   for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren: saying, I will
   declare thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the church will I
   sing praise unto thee.--In Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth
   any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.--Ye are
   my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.--Blessed are they that
   hear the word of God, and keep it.

   Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
   kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
   heaven.--My meat is to do the will of him that sent me.

   If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we
   lie, and do not the truth.--Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is
   the love of God perfected; hereby know we that we are in him.

   NOVEMBER 24 EVENING

   What doest thou here, Elijah?--I KGS. 19:9.

   He knoweth the way that I take.--O Lord, thou hast searched me, and
   known me. Thou knowest my downsitting, and mine uprising; thou
   understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path, and my
   lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. Whither shall I go
   from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I take
   the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
   even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.

   Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are.--The fear of man
   bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be
   safe.--Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord
   upholdeth him with his hand.--A just man falleth seven times, and
   riseth up again.

   Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if
   we faint not.--The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
   weak.--Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them
   that fear him.

   Job 23:10. -Psa. 139:1-3,7,9,10.Jas. 5:17. -Prov. 29:25. -Psa. 37:24.

   NOVEMBER 25 MORNING

   Being made free from sin, ye became the servants of
   righteousness.--ROM. 6:18.

   Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.--When ye were the servants of sin, ye
   were free from righteousness. What fruit had ye then in those things
   whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. But
   now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your
   fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

   Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
   believeth.

   If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall
   also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father
   honour.--Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me: for I am meek and
   lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is
   easy, and my burden is light.

   O Lord our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but
   by thee only will we make mention of thy name.--I will run the way of
   thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.

   Matt. 6:24. -Rom. 6:20-22.Rom. 10:4.John 12:26. -Matt. 11:29,30.Isa. 26:13. -Psa. 119:32.

   NOVEMBER 25 EVENING

   Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall he saved.--ACTS 2:21.

   Manasseh did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, after the
   abominations of the heathen, and he reared up altars for Baal. And he
   built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house
   of the Lord. And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed
   times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and
   wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to
   provoke him to anger.--And when he was in affliction, he besought the
   Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his
   fathers, and prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard
   his supplication.

   Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins
   be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
   crimson, they shall be as wool.--The Lord is longsuffering to us-ward,
   not willing that any should perish.

   II Kgs. 21:1-3,5,6. -II Chr. 33:12,13.Isa. 1:18. -II Pet. 3:9.

   NOVEMBER 26 MORNING

   The Lord delighteth in thee.--ISA. 62:4.

   Thus saith the Lord that created thee, . . . Fear not: for I have
   redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.--Can a
   woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on
   the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.
   Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of mine hands: thy walls are
   continually before me.

   The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in
   his way.--My delights were with the sons of men.--The Lord taketh
   pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.--They
   shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my
   jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that
   serveth him.

   You, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked
   works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through
   death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his
   sight.

   Isa. 43:1. -Isa. 49:15,16.Psa. 37:23. -Prov. 8:31. -Psa. 147:11. -Mal. 3:17.Col. 1:21,22.

   NOVEMBER 26 EVENING

   The sorrow of the world worketh death.--II COR. 7:10.

   When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his
   ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his
   household in order, and hanged himself, and died.--A wounded spirit who
   can bear?

   Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? why then is
   not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?--The Lord hath
   anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek: he hath sent me to
   bind up the broken-hearted, to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto
   them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of
   joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of
   heaviness.--Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
   will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am
   meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my
   yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

   Philip preached unto him Jesus.--He healeth the broken in heart, and
   bindeth up their wounds.

   II Sam. 17:23. -Prov. 18:14.Jer. 8:22. -Isa. 61:1-3. -Matt. 11:28-30.Acts 8:35. -Psa. 147:3.

   NOVEMBER 27 MORNING

   The glory which thou gavest me I have given them.--JOHN 17:22.

   I saw . . . the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his
   train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphims. And one cried
   unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts; the
   whole earth is full of his glory.--These things said Esaias, when he
   saw his glory, and spake of him.--Upon the likeness of the throne was
   the likeness . . . of a man above upon it. As the appearance of the bow
   that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the
   brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the
   glory of the Lord.

   I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. And he said, Thou canst not see my
   face: for there shall no man see me, and live.--No man hath seen God at
   any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father,
   he hath declared him.--God, who commanded the light to shine out of
   darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge
   of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

   Isa. 6:1-3. -John 12:41. -Ezek. 1:26,28.Exo. 33:18,20. -John 1:18. -II
   Cor. 4:6.
     __________________________________________________________________

   NOVEMBER 27 EVENING

   My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.--PROV. 1:10.

   She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her
   husband with her; and he did eat.--Did not Achan the son of Zerah
   commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the
   congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his
   iniquity.

   Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.

   Wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction,
   and many there be which go in thereat.

   None of us liveth to himself.--Brethren, ye have been called unto
   liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love
   serve one another.--Take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours
   become a stumblingblock to them that are weak. When ye sin so against
   the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.

   All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned every one to his
   own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.

   Gen. 3:6. -Josh. 22:20.Exo. 23:2.Matt. 7:13.Rom. 14:7. -Gal. 5:13. -I

   NOVEMBER 28 MORNING

   As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead
   also.--JAS. 2:26.

   Not every one that saith, . . . Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
   kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
   heaven.--Holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.--Add to
   your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge
   temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and
   to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For
   if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall
   neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar
   off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. Wherefore
   the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election
   sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.

   By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is
   the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.

   Matt. 7:21. -Heb. 12:14. -II Pet. 1:5-10.Eph. 2:8,9.
     __________________________________________________________________

   NOVEMBER 28 EVENING

   As the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself
   likewise took part of the same; that he might deliver them who through
   fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.--HEB. 2:14,15.

   O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be
   to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.--For
   which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the
   inward man is renewed day by day.

   We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we
   have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the
   heavens. Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are
   at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. We are willing rather
   to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.

   Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.
   In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have
   told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

   I Cor. 15:55,57. -II Cor. 4:16.II Cor. 5:1,6-8.John 14:1-3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   NOVEMBER 29 MORNING

   We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house.--PSA. 65:4.

   One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I
   may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold
   the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple.

   Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for
   they shall be filled.--He hath filled the hungry with good things; and
   the rich he hath sent empty away.

   He satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with
   goodness.--I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never
   hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.

   How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of
   men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. They shall be
   abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make
   them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain
   of life: in thy light shall we see light.

   Psa. 27:4.Matt. 5:6. -Luke 1:53.Psa. 107:9. -John 6:35.Psa. 36:7-9.
     __________________________________________________________________

   NOVEMBER 29 EVENING

   Do ye now believe?--JOHN 16:31.

   What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and
   have not works? can faith save him? Faith, if it hath not works, is
   dead, being alone.

   By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had
   received the promises offered up his only begotten son. Accounting that
   God was able to raise him up, even from the dead.--Was not Abraham our
   father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the
   altar? Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
   faith only.

   Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein,
   he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall
   be blessed in his deed.

   By their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me,
   Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth
   the will of my Father which is in heaven.--If ye know these things,
   happy are ye if ye do them.

   Jas. 2:14,17.Heb. 11:17-19. -Jas. 2:21,24.Jas. 1:25.Matt. 7:20,21.

   NOVEMBER 30 MORNING

   The Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord
   be with you all.--II THES. 3:16.

   Peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come.--The
   peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts
   and minds through Christ Jesus.

   Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be
   unto you.--Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the
   world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither
   let it be afraid.

   The Comforter . . . even the Spirit of truth.--The fruit of the Spirit
   is love, joy, peace.--The Spirit itself beareth witness with our
   spirit, that we are the children of God.

   My presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest. And he said
   unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. For
   wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace
   in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us?

   NOVEMBER 30 EVENING

   We glory in tribulations.--ROM. 5:3.

   If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
   miserable.

   Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to
   try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice,
   inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his
   glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding
   joy.--Sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing.

   Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, rejoice.--They departed
   from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted
   worthy to suffer shame for his name.

   The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing.

   Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the
   vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield
   no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be
   no herd in the stalls: Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in
   the God of my salvation.

   A man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the
   tempest.--ISA. 32:2.

   Forasmuch . . . as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he
   also himself likewise took part of the same.--The man that is my
   fellow, saith the Lord of hosts.--I and my Father are one.

   He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under
   the shadow of the Almighty.--There shall be a tabernacle for a shadow
   in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a
   covert from storm and from rain.--The Lord is thy shade upon thy right
   hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.

   When my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than
   I.--Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from
   trouble.--Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the
   needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat,
   when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.

   Heb. 2:14. -Zech. 13:7. -John 10:30.Psa. 91:1. -Isa. 4:6. -Psa. 121:5,6.Psa. 61:2. -Psa. 32:7. -Isa. 25:4.

   Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth.--ISA. 65:17.

   The new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain
   before me, . . . so shall your seed and your name remain.

   We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth,
   wherein dwelleth righteousness.

   I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first
   earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the
   holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared
   as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of
   heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will
   dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be
   with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from
   their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
   crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are
   passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all
   things new.

   Isa. 66:22.II Pet. 3:13.Rev. 21:1-5.

   DECEMBER 2 MORNING

   Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.--I JOHN 2:20.

   God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power.--It
   pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.--Of his
   fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.

   Thou anointest my head with oil.--The anointing which ye have received
   of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as
   the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no
   lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.

   The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
   name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your
   remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

   The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should
   pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us
   with groanings which cannot be uttered.

   DECEMBER 2 EVENING

   Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.--HEB. 10:22.

   If the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer
   sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: How
   much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit
   offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead
   works to serve the living God.--The blood of sprinkling, that speaketh
   better things than that of Abel.

   We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,
   according to the riches of his grace.

   When Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the
   law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet
   wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people.
   Moreover he sprinkled . . . with blood both the tabernacle, and all the
   vessels of the ministry. And almost all things are by the law purged
   with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.

   DECEMBER 3 MORNING

   I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause.--JOB 5:8.

   Is anything too hard for the Lord?--Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust
   also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.--Be careful for nothing;
   but in every thing by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let
   your requests be made known unto God.--Casting all your care upon him,
   for he careth for you.

   Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read
   it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord, and spread it
   before the Lord. And Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord.

   It shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while
   they are yet speaking, I will hear.--The effectual fervent prayer of a
   righteous man availeth much.

   I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.
   Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon
   him as long as I live.

   DECEMBER 3 EVENING

   Our bodies washed with pure water.--HEB. 10:22.

   Thou shalt . . . make a laver of brass, . . . and thou shalt put it
   between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou
   shalt put water therein. For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands
   and their feet thereat: when they go into the tabernacle of the
   congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; . . . they
   shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not.--Your body is
   the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you.--If any man defile the
   temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy,
   which temple ye are.

   In my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes
   shall behold, and not another.--There shall in no wise enter into it
   any thing that defileth.--Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil,
   and canst not look on iniquity.--I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by
   the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice,
   holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.

   Where shall wisdom be found?--JOB 28:12.

   If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
   liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him
   ask in faith, nothing wavering.--Trust in the Lord with all thine
   heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways
   acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.--The only wise God.--Be
   not wise in thine own eyes.

   Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child. But the Lord
   said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I
   shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. Be not
   afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the
   Lord.

   Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.
   Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive,
   that your joy may be full.--All things whatsoever ye shall ask in
   prayer, believing, ye shall receive.

   DECEMBER 4 EVENING

   I would not live alway.--JOB 7:16.

   And I said, O that I had wings like a dove, for then would I fly away,
   and be at rest. I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and
   tempest.

   In this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house
   which is from heaven. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan,
   being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon,
   that mortality might be swallowed up of life.--Having a desire to
   depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.

   Let us run with patience the race that is set before us. Looking unto
   Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who, for the joy that was
   set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down
   at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him that endured
   such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and
   faint in your minds.

   Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

   It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy
   statutes.--PSA. 119:71.

   Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he
   suffered.--We suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
   For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to
   be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.

   He knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come
   forth as gold. My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and
   not declined.

   Thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these
   forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to
   know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his
   commandments, or no. Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as
   a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee.
   Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, to walk
   in his ways, and to fear him.

   Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
   And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang
   it. So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
   stone.

   There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not
   delivered by much strength. Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them
   that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy.--Both riches and
   honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is
   power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give
   strength unto all.

   I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
   Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
   necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when
   I am weak, then am I strong.

   DECEMBER 6 MORNING

   It is God which worketh in you.--PHI. 2:13.

   Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of
   ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.--A man can receive nothing,
   except it be given him from heaven.--No man can come to me, except the
   Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last
   day.--And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear
   me for ever.

   Do not err, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect gift
   is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is
   no variableness, neither shadow of turning. Of his own will begat he us
   with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his
   creatures.

   For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
   which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

   Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our
   works in us.

   II Cor. 3:5. -John 3:27. -John 6:44. -Jer. 32:39.Jas. 1:16-18.Eph. 2:10.Isa. 26:12.

   DECEMBER 6 EVENING

   The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.--MATT. 26:41.

   In the way of thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for thee; the
   desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. With
   my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me
   will I seek thee early.

   I know that in me, (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing: for
   to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I
   find not. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: but I
   see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and
   bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my
   members.--The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against
   the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye
   cannot do the things that ye would.

   I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.--Our
   sufficiency is of God.--My grace is sufficient for thee.

   Isa. 26:8,9.Rom. 7:18,22,23. -Gal. 5:17.Phi. 4:13. -II Cor. 3:5. -II
   Cor. 12:9.
     __________________________________________________________________

   DECEMBER 7 MORNING

   He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be
   made the righteousness of God in him.--II COR. 5:21.

   The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.--Who his own self
   bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins,
   should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.--As by
   one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of
   one shall many be made righteous.

   After that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man
   appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
   according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and
   renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through
   Jesus Christ our Saviour; that being justified by his grace, we should
   be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.--There is
   therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who
   walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

   The Lord our Righteousness.

   Isa. 53:6. -I Pet. 2:24. -Rom. 5:19.Tit. 3:4-7. -Rom. 8:1.Jer. 23:6.

   DECEMBER 7 EVENING

   I will be as the dew unto Israel.--HOS. 14:5.

   The meekness and gentleness of Christ.

   A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not
   quench.

   The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to
   preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the
   brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of
   sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach
   the acceptable year of the Lord. And he began to say unto them, This
   day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. And all bare him witness,
   and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.

   And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter, and Peter remembered the
   word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou
   shalt deny me thrice. And Peter went out and wept bitterly.

   He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with
   his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that
   are with young.

   II Cor. 10:1.Isa. 42:3.Luke 4:18,19,21,22.Luke 22:61,62.Isa. 40:11.

   DECEMBER 8 MORNING

   By love serve one another.--GAL. 5:13.

   Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual,
   restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself,
   lest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil
   the law of Christ.

   Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; let
   him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way
   shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of
   sins.--Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
   the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one
   another with a pure heart fervently.--Owe no man any thing, but to love
   one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.--Be
   kindly affectioned one to another in brotherly love; in honour
   preferring one another.--Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and
   be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace
   to the humble.

   We . . . that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and
   not to please ourselves.

   Gal. 6:1,2.Jas. 5:19,20. -I Pet. 1:22. -Rom. 13:8. -Rom. 12:10. -I Pet. 5:5.Rom. 15:1.

   DECEMBER 8 EVENING

   The dust shall return to the earth as it was.--ECCL. 12:7.

   It is sown in corruption; it is sown in dishonour; it is sown in
   weakness; it is sown a natural body.--The first man is of the earth,
   earthy.

   Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.--One dieth in his full
   strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. And another dieth in the
   bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. They shall lie
   down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.

   My flesh . . . shall rest in hope.--Though after my skin worms destroy
   this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.--The Lord Jesus Christ
   shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his
   glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to
   subdue all things unto himself.

   Lord, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is;
   that I may know how frail I am.--So teach us to number our days, that
   we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.

   DECEMBER 9 MORNING

   To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than
   sacrifice.--PROV. 21:3.

   He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord
   require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk
   humbly with thy God?--Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings
   and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is
   better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.--To love
   him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all
   the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as
   himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.

   Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on
   thy God continually.--Mary . . . sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his
   word. One thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which
   shall not be taken away from her.

   It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good
   pleasure.

   Mic. 6:8. -I Sam. 15:22. -Mark 12:33.Hos. 12:6. -Luke 10:39,42.Phi. 2:13.

   DECEMBER 9 EVENING

   The spirit shall return unto God who gave it.--ECCL. 12:7.

   The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into
   his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.--There
   is a spirit in man; and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them
   understanding.--The first man Adam was made a living soul.--The spirit
   of man that goeth upward.

   Whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. We are
   confident, . . . and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to
   be present with the Lord.--With Christ; which is far better.--I would
   not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are
   asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if
   we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which
   sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

   I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for
   you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am,
   there ye may be also.

   Gen. 2:7. -Job 32:8. -I Cor. 15:45. -Eccl. 3:21.II Cor. 5:6,8. -Phi. 1:23. -I Thes. 4:13,14.John 14:2,3.

   DECEMBER 10 MORNING

   No man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.--JOHN 10:29.

   I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep
   that which I have committed unto him against that day.--The Lord shall
   deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly
   kingdom.--We are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I
   am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
   principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
   height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
   from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.--Your life is
   hid with Christ in God.

   Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of
   the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?

   Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath
   loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope
   through grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word
   and work.

   DECEMBER 10 EVENING

   The perfect law of liberty.--JAS. 1:25.

   Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.
   If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.

   Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free,
   and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. For, brethren, ye
   have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to
   the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled
   in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
   thyself.--Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
   righteousness.--For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law
   to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is
   loosed from the law of her husband.

   The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from
   the law of sin and death.--I will walk at liberty, for I seek thy
   precepts.

   John 8:32-34,36.Gal. 5:1,13,14. -Rom. 6:18. -Rom. 7:2.Rom. 8:2. -Psa. 119:45.
     __________________________________________________________________

   DECEMBER 11 MORNING

   Let not your good be evil spoken of.--ROM. 14:16.

   Abstain from all appearance of evil.--Providing for honest things, not
   only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.--For so is
   the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the
   ignorance of foolish men.

   But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an
   evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters. Yet if any man
   suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God
   on this behalf.

   Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an
   occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.--Take heed lest
   by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that
   are weak.--Whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in
   me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
   and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.--Inasmuch as ye have
   done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it
   unto me.

   DECEMBER 11 EVENING

   Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall
   give thee light.--EPH. 5:14.

   It is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer
   than when we believed.--Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but
   let us watch and be sober. For they that sleep sleep in the night: and
   they that be drunken are drunken in the night. But let us, who are of
   the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and
   for an helmet, the hope of salvation.

   Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen
   upon thee. For behold darkness shall cover the earth, and gross
   darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory
   shall be seen upon thee.

   Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end
   for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus
   Christ.--Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and
   ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord.

   DECEMBER 12 MORNING

   The Lord is in the midst of thee.--ZEPH. 3:15.

   Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I
   will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee
   with the right hand of my righteousness.--Strengthen ye the weak hands,
   and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart,
   Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even
   God with a recompence; He will come and save you.--The Lord thy God in
   the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee
   with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with
   singing.--Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
   thine heart.

   I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of
   God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his
   people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God
   shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more
   death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more
   pain.

   Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that
   they go forward.--EXO. 14:15.

   Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our
   people, and for the cities of our God: and let the Lord do that which
   is good in his sight.--We made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch
   against them day and night.

   Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
   kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
   heaven.--If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
   whether it be of God.--Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the
   Lord.

   Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.--Watch ye, stand
   fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.--Not slothful in
   business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.

   Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them
   that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not.

   Be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.--II TIM. 2:1.

   Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power.--As ye
   have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:
   rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have
   been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.--Trees of
   righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be
   glorified.--Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
   Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the
   building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord:
   in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God through
   the Spirit.

   I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to
   build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are
   sanctified.--Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are
   by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.

   Fight the good fight of faith.--In nothing terrified by your
   adversaries.

   DECEMBER 13 EVENING

   Thou renderest to every man according to his work.--PSA. 62:12.

   Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus
   Christ. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall
   receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer
   loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.--We must all
   appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive
   the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it
   be good or bad.

   When thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand
   doeth: that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in
   secret himself shall reward thee openly.--After a long time the lord of
   those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.

   Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of
   ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.--Lord, thou wilt ordain peace
   for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.

   praise.--I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have
   sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they
   have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me. And it
   shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the
   nations of the earth.--By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of
   praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks
   to his name.

   I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will
   glorify thy name for evermore. For great is thy mercy toward me: and
   thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.--Who is like unto
   thee, O Lord, . . . glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing
   wonders?--I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify
   him with thanksgiving.--They sing the song of Moses the servant of God

   Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.--GAL. 6:2.

   Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things
   of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who
   . . . took upon him the form of a servant.--Even the Son of man came
   not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a
   ransom for many.--He died for all, that they which live should not
   henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and
   rose again.

   When Jesus . . . saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came
   with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.--Jesus
   wept.--Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.

   Be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as
   brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: not rendering evil for evil or
   railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are
   thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.

   Reckon ye . . . yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto
   God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in your
   mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield
   ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin; but yield
   yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your
   members as instruments of righteousness unto God.--As obedient
   children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in

   in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I
   am holy.--Sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto
   every good work.

   Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always
   abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your
   labour is not in vain in the Lord.

   They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

   As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my
   love.--Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
   for his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command
   you.--A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I
   have loved you, that ye also love one another.

   He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of
   Jesus Christ.--Christ . . . loved the church, and gave himself for it;
   that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the
   word.

   The deep things of God.--I COR. 2:10.

   Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what
   his lord doeth; but I have called you friends; for all things that I
   have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.--It is given unto
   you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.

   We have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is
   of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of
   God.

   For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would
   grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened
   with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that ye, being rooted and
   grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the
   breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of
   Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the
   fulness of God.

   John 15:15. -Matt. 13:11.I Cor. 2:12.Eph. 3:14-19.

   DECEMBER 17 MORNING

   Quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.--PSA. 80:18.

   It is the Spirit that quickeneth.--The Spirit also helpeth our
   infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but
   the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which
   cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the
   mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints
   according to the will of God.--Praying always with all prayer and
   supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all
   perseverance.

   I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened
   me.--The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are
   life.--The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.--If ye abide in
   me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall
   be done unto you.--This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if
   we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.

   No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

   DECEMBER 17 EVENING

   Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
   reprove them.--EPH. 5:11.

   Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

   Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? Purge out
   therefore the old leaven. I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company
   with fornicators. Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this
   world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolators; for
   then must we needs go out of the world. I have written unto you not to
   keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or
   covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an
   extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.--That ye may be blameless
   and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a
   crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the
   world.

   In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but
   also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.

   DECEMBER 18 MORNING

   Let us come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy,
   and find grace to help in time of need.--HEB. 4:16.

   Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication
   with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the
   peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts
   and minds through Christ Jesus.--Ye have not received the spirit of
   bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption,
   whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

   I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain.--Having
   therefore, . . . boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of
   Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us,
   through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; and having an high priest
   over the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart in full
   assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
   conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.--We may boldly say,
   The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

   DECEMBER 18 EVENING

   Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.--JOHN 8:32.

   Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.--The law of the
   Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin
   and death.--If the Son . . . shall make you free, ye shall be free
   indeed.

   Brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the
   free.--Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but
   by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ,
   that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works
   of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.

   Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein,
   he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall
   be blessed in his deed.--Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith
   Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of
   bondage.

   DECEMBER 19 MORNING

   Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness.--PSA. 112:4.

   Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his
   servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in
   the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.--Though he fall, he shall
   not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his
   hand.--The commandment is a lamp, and the law is light.

   Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when
   I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me. I will bear the
   indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he
   plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to
   the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.

   The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy
   whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole
   body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee
   be darkness, how great is that darkness!

   Isa. 50:10. -Psa. 37:24. -Prov. 6:23.Mic. 7:8,9.Matt. 6:22,23.

   DECEMBER 19 EVENING

   He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with
   his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lend those that
   are with young.--ISA. 40:11.

   I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now
   three days, and have nothing to eat: . . . I will not send them away
   fasting, lest they faint in the way.--We have not an high priest which
   cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.

   They brought young children to him, and he took them up in his arms,
   put his hands upon them, and blessed them.

   I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant.--The Son of man
   is come to seek and to save that which was lost.--Ye were as sheep
   going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your
   souls.

   Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give
   you the kingdom.--I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie
   down, saith the Lord God.

   DECEMBER 20 MORNING

   He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world.--EPH. 1:4.

   That we should be holy and without blame before him in love.

   God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through
   sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: whereunto he
   called you, . . . to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus
   Christ.--Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed
   to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many
   brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and
   whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he
   also glorified.--Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the
   Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and
   sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.

   A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within
   you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will
   give you a heart of flesh.--God hath not called us unto uncleanness,
   but unto holiness.

   If the Lord would make windows in heaven might this thing be?--II KGS. 7:2.

   Have faith in God.--Without faith it is impossible to please God.--With
   God all things are possible.

   Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power
   to deliver?

   My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith
   the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
   higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.--Prove me
   now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the
   windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be
   room enough to receive it.

   Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither
   his ear heavy, that it cannot hear.--Lord, it is nothing with thee to
   help, whether with many or with them that have no power.

   We should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead.

   DECEMBER 21 MORNING

   The days of thy mourning shall be ended.--ISA. 60:20.

   In the world ye shall have tribulation.--The whole creation groaneth
   and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only they, but
   ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we
   ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the
   redemption of our body.--We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being
   burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that
   mortality might be swallowed up of life.

   These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed
   their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, Therefore
   are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his
   temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They
   shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun
   light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the
   throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of
   waters; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

   Master, carest thou not that we perish?--MARK 4:38.

   The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.

   Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green
   herb have I given you all things.--While the earth remaineth, seedtime
   and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and
   night, shall not cease.

   The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth
   them that trust in him.--God heard the voice of the lad: and the angel
   of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth
   thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he
   is. And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went,
   and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

   Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, what shall we drink?
   for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these
   things.--Trust . . . in the living God, who giveth us richly all things
   to enjoy.

   DECEMBER 22 MORNING

   Your work of faith.--I THES. 1:3.

   This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.

   Faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.--Faith worketh by
   love.--He that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption;
   but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life
   everlasting.--We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
   works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.--Who
   gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and
   purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

   We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet,
   because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every
   one of you all toward each other aboundeth. Wherefore also we pray
   always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling,
   and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith
   with power.--It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of
   his good pleasure.

   DECEMBER 22 EVENING

   Where is the promise of his coming?--II PET. 3:4.

   Enoch . . . the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold,
   the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment
   upon all.--Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,
   and they also which pierced him; and all kindreds of the earth shall
   wail because of him.

   The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice
   of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ
   shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
   together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
   shall we ever be with the Lord.

   The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
   teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
   soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for
   that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our
   Saviour Jesus Christ.

   Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me.--ISA. 27:5.

   I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts
   of peace, and not of evil.--There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the
   wicked.

   In Christ Jesus ye who sometime were far off are made nigh by the blood
   of Christ. For he is our peace.

   It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell: and having
   made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all
   things unto himself.--Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a
   propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness
   for the remission of sins that are past: . . . that he might be just,
   and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.--If we confess our
   sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us
   from all unrighteousness.

   Trust ye in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovahis everlasting
   strength.

   God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.--I JOHN 5:11.

   As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have
   life in himself. As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth
   them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.

   I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he
   were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
   shall never die.--I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his
   life for the sheep. I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No
   man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay
   it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I
   received of my Father.--No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.--He
   that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God, hath
   not life.--For ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God.
   When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear
   with him in glory.

   John 5:26,21.John 11:25,26. -John 10:11,17,18. -John 14:6. -I John 5:12. -Col. 3:3,4.

   DECEMBER 24 MORNING

   If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit
   do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.--ROM. 8:13.

   Now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these; adultery,
   fornication and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have
   also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not
   inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
   peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
   temperance: against such there is no law. And they that are Christ's
   have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in
   the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

   The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
   teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
   soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for
   that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our
   Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us
   from all iniquity.

   DECEMBER 24 EVENING

   Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews
   here?--I SAM. 29:3.

   If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye: for the
   spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil
   spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. But let none of you suffer
   as a murderer, or as a thief, . . . or as a busybody in other men's
   matters.

   Let not . . . your good be evil spoken of.--Having your conversation
   honest among the Gentiles.

   Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what
   fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion
   hath light with darkness? Ye are the temple of the living God.
   Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord,
   and touch not the unclean thing.

   Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a
   peculiar people: that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath
   called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.

   DECEMBER 25 MORNING

   The kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared.--TIT. 3:4.

   I have loved thee with an everlasting love.

   In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent
   his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
   Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent
   his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

   When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of
   a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law,
   that we might receive the adoption of sons.--The Word was made flesh,
   and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
   begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth.--Great is the mystery
   of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh.

   As the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself
   likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him
   that had the power of death, that is, the devil.

   Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands. Serve the Lord with
   gladness; come before his presence with singing. Enter into his gates
   with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto
   him, and bless his name.--For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
   given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name
   shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting
   Father, The Prince of Peace.

   He . . . spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
   all.--Having yet . . . one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him.

   Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his
   wonderful works to the children of men!--Bless the Lord, O my soul: and
   all that is within me, bless his holy name.

   Be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the
   Lord.--I COR. 15:58.

   Ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.--As ye have . . .
   received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: rooted and built up
   in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding
   therein with thanksgiving.--He that shall endure unto the end, the same
   shall be saved.--That on the good ground are they, which in an honest
   and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit
   with patience.

   By faith ye stand.

   I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night
   cometh, when no man can work.

   He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he
   that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
   And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap,
   if we faint not. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto
   all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

   I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father,
   but by me.--Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
   other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

   My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give
   unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any
   man pluck them out of my hand.--He which hath begun a good work in you

   Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you

   not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things
   which are not seen are eternal.--II COR. 4:18.

   Here have we no continuing city.--Ye have in heaven a better and an
   enduring substance.

   Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give
   you the kingdom.

   Now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold
   temptations.--There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the
   weary be at rest.

   We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened.--God shall
   wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death,
   neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for
   the former things are passed away.

   The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with
   the glory which shall be revealed in us.--Our light affliction, which
   is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal
   weight of glory.

   Heb. 13:14. -Heb. 10:34.Luke 12:32.I Pet. 1:6. -Job 3:17.II Cor. 5:4.
   -Rev. 21:4.Rom. 8:18. -II Cor. 4:17.

   DECEMBER 27 EVENING

   He is our peace.--EPH. 2:14.

   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing
   their trespasses unto them; for he hath made him to be sin for us, who
   knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in
   him.--Having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to
   reconcile all things unto himself. And you that were sometime alienated
   and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in
   the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and
   unblameable and unreproveable in his sight.--Blotting out the
   handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to
   us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.--Having
   abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments
   contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man,
   so making peace.

   Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world
   giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it
   be afraid.

   II Cor. 5:19,21. -Col. 1:20-22. -Col. 2:14. -Eph. 2:15.John 14:27.

   DECEMBER 28 MORNING

   Thy sins be forgiven thee.--MARK 2:5.

   I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no
   more.--Who can forgive sins but God only?

   I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own
   sake, and will not remember thy sins.--Blessed is he whose
   transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man
   unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity.--Who is a God like unto thee,
   that pardoneth iniquity?

   God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.--The blood of Jesus Christ his
   Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we
   deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins,
   he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from
   all unrighteousness.

   As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
   transgressions from us.--Sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye
   are not under the law, but under grace. Being then made free from sin,
   ye became the servants of righteousness.

   Jer. 31:34. -Mark 2.7.Isa. 43:25. -Psa. 32:1,2. -Mic. 7:18.Eph. 4:32.
   -I John 1:7-9.Psa. 103:12. -Rom. 6:14,18.

   DECEMBER 28 EVENING

   We would see Jesus.--JOHN 12:21.

   O Lord, we have waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name,
   and to the remembrance of thee.

   The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call
   upon him in truth.

   Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the
   midst of them.--I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to
   you.--Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.

   Let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto
   Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.

   Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face.--Having a
   desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.

   Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we
   shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him;
   for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him
   purifieth himself, even as he is pure.

   Isa. 26:8.Psa. 145:18.Matt. 18:20. -John 14:18. -Matt. 28:20.Heb. 12:1,2.I Cor. 13:12. -Phi. 1:23.I John 3:2,3.

   DECEMBER 29 MORNING

   Understanding what the will of the Lord is.--EPH. 5:17.

   This is the will of God, even your sanctification.--Acquaint now
   thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto
   thee.--This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
   God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.--We know that the Son of
   God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him
   that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus
   Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.

   We . . . do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be
   filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
   understanding.--The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
   . . . give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
   knowledge of him: the eyes of your understanding being enlightened;
   that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches
   of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the
   exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe.

   I Thes. 4:3. -Job 22:21. -John 17:3. -I John 5:20.Col. 1:9. -Eph. 1:17-19.

   DECEMBER 29 EVENING

   Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.--JAMES 4:8.

   Enoch walked with God.--Can two walk together, except they be
   agreed?--It is good for me to draw near to God.

   The Lord is with you, while ye be with him: and if ye seek him, he will
   be found of you: but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you. When they
   in their trouble did turn unto the Lord God of Israel, and sought him,
   he was found of them.

   For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord,
   thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then
   shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will
   hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall
   search for me with all your heart.

   Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the
   blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, . . . and having an high
   priest over the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart in
   full assurance of faith.

   Gen. 5:24. -Amos 3:3. -Psa. 73:28.II Chr. 15:2,4.Jer. 29:11-13.Heb. 10:19-22.

   DECEMBER 30 MORNING

   Blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.--I COR. 1:8.

   You, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked
   works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through
   death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his
   sight: if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not
   moved away from the hope of the gospel.--That ye may be blameless and
   harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked
   and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.

   Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent
   that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and
   blameless.--Sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.

   Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you
   faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the
   only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power,
   both now and ever.

   Col. 1:21-23. -Phi 2:15. II Pet. 3:14. -Phi. 1:10.Jude 24,25.

   DECEMBER 30 EVENING

   He will keep the feet of his saints.--I SAM. 2:9.

   If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we
   lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the light, as he is in the
   light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus
   Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.--He that is washed needeth
   not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit.

   I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right
   paths. When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when
   thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. Enter not into the path of the
   wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. Avoid it, pass not by it,
   turn from it, and pass away. Let thine eyes look right on, and let
   thine eyelids look straight before thee. Ponder the path of thy feet,
   and let all thy ways be established. Turn not to the right hand nor to
   the left: remove thy foot from evil.

   The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me
   unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

   I John 1:6,7. -John 13:10.Prov. 4:11,12,14,15,25-27.II Tim. 4:18.

   DECEMBER 31 MORNING

   The Lord thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way
   that ye went, until ye came into this place.--DEUT. 1:31.

   I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.--In his love
   and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them
   all the days of old.--As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over
   her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her
   wings: so the Lord alone did lead him.

   Even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you:
   I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver
   you.--This God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even
   unto death.

   Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee.--Take no
   thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor
   yet for your body, what ye shall put on. For your heavenly Father
   knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

   Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.

   Exo. 19:4. -Isa. 63:9. -Deut. 32:11,12.Isa. 46:4. -Psa. 48:14.Psa. 55:22. -Matt. 6:25,32.I Sam. 7:12.

   DECEMBER 31 EVENING

   There remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.--JOSH. 13:1.

   Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but
   I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am
   apprehended of Christ Jesus.

   Be ye therefore perfect.--Giving all diligence, add to your faith
   virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to
   temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness
   brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.

   I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in
   all judgment.

   Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart
   of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But
   God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.

   There remaineth . . . a rest for the people of God.--Thine eyes shall
   see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far
   off.

   Phi. 3:12.Matt. 5:48. -II Pet. 1:5-7.Phi. 1:9.I Cor. 2:9,10.Heb. 4:9.
   -Isa. 33:17.
